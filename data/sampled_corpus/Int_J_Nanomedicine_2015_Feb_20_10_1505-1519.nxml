Various technological applications have been reported for graphene such as in nanoelectronics, supercapacitors, polymer nanocomposites, drug delivery systems, biosensing, solar cells, memory electronics, optoelectronics, transistor devices, etc.<xref rid="b1-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, graphene sheet, also known as reduced graphene oxide (RGO), is hydrophobic and tends to agglomerate irreversibly or even transforms back to graphite due to its van der Waals&#x02019; interaction and its stronger &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking, which limits its further applications. Therefore, the route of synthesis of RGO is of vital importance to impart stability as most of its unique electrical and mechanical properties are associated only with the individualized graphene sheets.<xref rid="b3-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, imparting solubility in water is also crucial as a well-dispersed RGO would allow further functionalization and open opportunities for various technological applications.</p><p>Several methods have been reported to obtain RGO such as micromechanical cleavage,<xref rid="b6-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> epitaxial growth,<xref rid="b7-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> chemical vapor deposition,<xref rid="b8-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> unzipping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs),<xref rid="b9-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO).<xref rid="b10-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Micromechanical method suffers from low productivity which hinders large scale applications;<xref rid="b11-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the epitaxial growth method produces graphene with random and uncontrollable thickness;<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> whereas the methods of chemical vapor deposition and unzipping of CNTs involve using several chemicals and lengthy reaction steps, besides being tedious. Hence, much focus has been placed on solution-based reduction of GO which generally produces single to few-layer graphene sheets. Conventional thermal reduction, however, requires higher temperatures and pressures for the removal of intercalated water molecules and oxide functional groups.<xref rid="b11-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, it requires specific reaction vessels and may cause environmental and economic concerns when large scale production is considered.</p><p>Therefore, researchers are more interested in finding out suitable reducing agents. The most commonly used chemical reducing agents are anhydrous hydrazine,<xref rid="b13-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> hydrazine monohydrate,<xref rid="b14-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> sodium borohydride,<xref rid="b15-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and hydroquinone.<xref rid="b16-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These reducing agents are highly toxic, harmful, and explosive. Moreover, hydrazine-reduced graphene tends to agglomerate irreversibly and converts into graphite.<xref rid="b17-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Metal/hydrochloric acid reduction is another alternative; however, impurities formed from the residual metal hinders further applications.<xref rid="b18-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Recently, reduction of GO using environmentally friendly organic agents such as vitamin C,<xref rid="b20-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> amino acid,<xref rid="b21-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> glucose,<xref rid="b22-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> protein,<xref rid="b23-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> green tea,<xref rid="b24-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> dextran,<xref rid="b26-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> bacterial respiration,<xref rid="b27-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref rid="b12-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> have taken a center stage and have been proposed as alternatives. Although these methods are eco-friendly, they demand tedious experimental procedures and require expensive reagents and longer reaction times. Besides, some of these methods introduce foreign materials to RGO that may reduce its purity and limit its further applications. An additional step of sonication is often necessary to produce good dispersion in water. Moreover, incomplete reduction and formation of large graphene aggregates hamper its good electrical conductivity.<xref rid="b28-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Most of the reports also claim their suitability for drug delivery; however, cytotoxicity studies on normal healthy cells have never been looked into. Thus, there is an impending demand to develop an easy approach which can produce RGO with good purity but without losing its excellent electrical properties and its biocompatibility.</p><p><italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (GL), widely known as Reishi in Japan or Ling Zhi in People&#x02019;s Republic of China, has been a popular mushroom often used in many medicinal applications. It is used in the treatment of a variety of ailments such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, cancer, and AIDS.<xref rid="b29-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In Asia and North America, usage of this mushroom extends to nutraceuticals and food processing due to many of its astounding properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral.<xref rid="b30-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> One of the interesting properties of this mushroom extract is its high content of polysaccharides which exhibit strong antioxidant properties.<xref rid="b32-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> More specifically, the antioxidant quality is mainly contributed by the high content of glucans, which has been observed more in GL compared to any other <italic>Ganoderma</italic> sp.<xref rid="b31-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Besides polysaccharides being the major components, the GL extract also contains proteins and polyphenols;<xref rid="b29-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> however, the higher content of glucan supersedes the content of the former two, and thus it is safe to assume that the excellent reducing ability is mainly due to the polysaccharides (glucans). In addition to glucans, the presence of reducing sugars such as glucose and galactose in the polysaccharide further contributes to its reducing potential.<xref rid="b36-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Moreover, the excellent reducing ability of polysaccharide was also proven by the ability to scavenge DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals well, good antioxidant activity, and chelating ability on ferrous ions.<xref rid="b31-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Thus, using GL extract as a reducing agent in eco-friendly RGO synthesis is a promising prospect. In addition to this, the polysaccharide is highly soluble in water and does not react with RGO, and as a consequence, a simple ultracentrifugation step can be carried out to separate the reducing agent (extract) after the reaction. Hence, we propose a strategy to produce RGO with the following multitude of benefits: 1) one-step simple synthesis; 2) environmentally friendly process; 3) feasibility to produce in larger quantities, hence economical; 4) high purity with absolute removal of mushroom extract; 5) unperturbed electrical properties; and 6) biocompatibility towards cells.</p><p>Our present investigation is different from the recently published work where mushroom was used as a reducing agent for RGO synthesis.<xref rid="b38-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The major differences can be seen in terms of method of synthesis and the results obtained. Our method requires only 3 hours of preparation and the whole mushroom was used to prepare the mushroom extract for reduction instead of separating the mycelia, which is cumbersome and takes a total of 17 days to prepare. In addition, our reduction reaction is much simpler, whereby it was conducted for 16 hours using a water bath, allowing for bulk production, instead of subjecting to ultrasonication for 24 hours. According to atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and size distribution analysis, the RGO obtained in our case is of 1&#x02013;2 nm thickness, with 3&#x02013;5 layers, and 181 nm lateral dimension, respectively, instead of much bigger size and thicker sheets, as reported. Moreover, we have carried out the biocompatibility studies both with cancer cells and normal cells, compared to other reports in which only cytotoxicity studies on cancer cells were determined, disregarding the effects of their synthesized RGO on normal cells, which is crucial, especially for drug-delivery or biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Graphite was purchased from Asbury Graphite Mills, Inc.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of solid samples were recorded on a FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum RX1; Perkin Elmer) in the frequency range of 4,000&#x02013;400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The crystalline nature of synthesized RGO was investigated by using a X&#x02019;Pert Pro diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, the Netherlands). The XRD was operated at 45 kV with a current of 35 mA using Cu/k&#x003b1; radiation (&#x003bb;=1.54060 &#x000c5;). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen flow (50 mL/min) using a TGA/differential scanning calorimetry 1, Stare System (Mettler Toledo Inc., OH, USA). Samples were heated from room temperature to 1,000&#x000b0;C at 5&#x000b0;C/min. Ultrasonication was employed by using a Cole Parmer dip-stick sonicator (20 kHz &#x000b1;5 kHz), which has a tapered microtip of 0.25 inches, with an amplitude of 40%. Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) was used to analyze the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles. Samples dispersed in absolute ethanol were drop-casted on Si substrate and dried in air before subjecting to Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Raman spectra were acquired on an inVia Raman Microscope (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK) with 514 nm laser excitation source. XPS measurements were performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) spectrometer equipped with a monochromatized Al k&#x003b1; radiation and frequency of hv =1,486.6 eV. The graphene/ethanol suspension was also drop-casted on Cu grid (3 nm thick) and mica substrate for high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), AFM, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). HRTEM images were acquired using a Philip model (JOEL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The thickness of graphene materials was examined using a 5500 Agilent Technologies AFM System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using ultrasharp tips (non-contact high resonance frequency, nanosensor probe). Morphological analysis was carried out using field emission gun scanning electron microscopy Quanta SEM 400 instrument (FEI, Oregon, USA). Electrochemical studies were conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with a Princeton Applied Research Versastat electrochemical station. Potential range was set at &#x02212;0.1 V to 0.6 V with a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Three electrode cells were used; a Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode; platinum wire as the counter electrode; and a bare and modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the working electrode.

After 16 hours, no change in the color was observed in the GO&#x02013;GL mixture that was kept at RT. However, a marginal red shift to 240 nm could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-10-1505">Figure 2B</xref>) in the UV&#x02013;Vis spectrum with a shoulder peak at around 300 nm suggesting that only an insignificant amount of GO was converted to RGO, thus confirming the need of heat for a complete reduction of GO to take place. Heat is often introduced in the reduction of GO to allow its thermal expansion and exfoliation to produce single or few-layered graphene sheets.<xref rid="b45-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In addition, similar to conventional hot water extraction, heat is required in this reaction to further breakdown the cell walls of the mushroom and to liberate the polysaccharides<xref rid="b46-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> which have the reducing properties. However, heating of GO alone without GL extract did not convert GO to RGO, as confirmed by the absence of absorbance peak at 260 nm in the UV&#x02013;Vis spectrum. The corresponding image as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-10-1505">Figure 2A</xref> illustrates that GO solution has turned to dark brown, probably due to the heat which induces darkening of the solution but does not convert GO to RGO, thus verifying the need of GL extract as a reducing agent. In comparison, reaction of GO with GL extract at 85&#x000b0;C produces a distinctive peak of graphene, appearing at 260 nm. Hereafter, the GO reduced by GL extract at 85&#x000b0;C is labeled as RGO.</p><p>To determine the capability of mushroom extract for its reusage in the reduction, GL extract after first usage was separated from the product via simple ultracentrifugation and reused to reduce the GO. By assuming a complete reduction in the first usage, about 75% conversion of GO was still observed even after the third use of GL extract as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-10-1505">Table 1</xref>. This indicates that GL extract can be reused several times without significantly losing its reducing properties, which could be lucrative for large-scale production of RGO. The conversion of GO to RGO was calculated by measuring the absorbance of RGO at 260 nm and the amount of RGO formed was determined by using a RGO standard calibration curve. In the first cycle, 5 mg of GO was found to produce 5 mg of RGO, thus showing a 100% conversion.</p><p>The formation of RGO is further confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-10-1505">Figure 3A</xref>. FTIR spectra of GO shows a strong absorption peak of &#x003bd;<sub>O-H</sub> at 3,412 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to stretching vibration and a deformation peak at 1,396 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to the hydroxyl groups located on the plane of GO.

Successful deoxygenation could be seen for RGO with the disappearance and reduced intensity of all the oxide functional groups. A broad C-O band that appears from 1,214 to 1,000 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> even after reduction could be attributed to oxygen atoms or cyclic ether accumulated at the edges of defects in RGO. This indicates that all the oxygen groups are removed from the region adjacent to edges and only clean graphene domains are present in RGO.<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b48-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> It is reported that the oxygen moieties present on the edges of RGO do not affect the electronic properties of RGO.<xref rid="b49-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The spectra of GL extract exhibit a broad band around 3,397 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to the stretching of N-H and O-H groups, and a corresponding N-H bending at 1,639.5 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

The sharp peaks at 1,074.4 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and at 1,046.5 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are due to C-O stretching and bending of C-OH in the polysaccharide.<xref rid="b50-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The absence of these characteristic peaks in RGO confirms the complete removal of GL extract after the reaction.</p><p>XRD analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-10-1505">Figure 3B</xref>) is a good tool to estimate the interlayer spacing between the graphitic layers and the crystalline properties, as well as to determine the completion of reaction. Graphite exhibits a strong basal reflection (002) peak at 2&#x003b8;=26.6&#x000b0; with an interlayer distance (d-spacing) of approximately 0.33 nm. This intense crystalline peak is a characteristic peak of hexagonal pristine graphite. The disappearance of this peak in GO confirms the complete oxidation of graphite. Upon oxidation, the diffraction peak (001) of GO appears at a lower angle (2&#x003b8;=9.2&#x000b0;) with a d-spacing of 0.96 nm. The larger interlayer spacing after oxidation is due to the intercalation of oxide functional groups on both sides of GO sheets. In addition, structural defects (sp<xref rid="b3-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> bonding) generated on the originally flat graphite sheets contribute to atomic-scale roughness and thus a larger d-spacing of GO.<xref rid="b52-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> After reduction, the distinctive GO peak of RGO disappears, indicating a complete reduction as well as exfoliation of the layered RGO sheets.<xref rid="b22-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b53-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> A broad peak has been observed for RGO, starting from 2&#x003b8;=15&#x000b0; to 2&#x003b8;=30&#x000b0;, with the peak centered at 2&#x003b8;=24&#x000b0;, and a d-spacing of 0.37 nm. The appearance of this peak at 24.0&#x000b0; is due to restoration of van der Waals&#x02019; interaction between the carbon frameworks on the graphene sheets upon reduction. The presence of a broad peak indicates the loss of long range order in the graphene sheets, the graphene sheets are stacked with few-layers.<xref rid="b17-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b47-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b54-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> In addition, the significant reduction in the interlayer spacing of RGO as compared to GO suggests the removal of oxygen groups and water molecules from the interlayer of graphene sheets in RGO. However, a difference in the interlayer distance of approximately 0.04 nm between the pristine graphite and RGO is observed. This is probably due to the fact that it is impossible to revive the original &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking between the graphene sheets after the extreme intercalation of oxygenous groups into the graphite during the chemical oxidation process. The GO sheets had probably crumpled during the exfoliation stage and remained in that position even after reduction.<xref rid="b56-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p><p>The formation of RGO was further confirmed by XPS analysis. The C1s of GO as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-10-1505">Figure 4A</xref> demonstrates the highest intensity at the binding energy of 287.8 eV, which belongs to carbonyl functional groups. Other peaks at 284.8, 286.3, and 289.1 eV correspond to C=C/C-C in aromatic rings; C-O in hydroxyl and epoxy groups; and O-C=O in carboxyl groups, respectively.<xref rid="b12-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b57-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> After reduction, the peak intensity for all the oxygen species decreased dramatically, suggesting the effective removal of oxygen-containing groups in RGO. In addition, a sharp increase in the C=C/C-C peak at 284.4 eV and the appearance of a &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0;* peak at 288.5 eV indicate the restoration of sp<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> carbon network.<xref rid="b58-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> C/O molar ratio calculated from the peak areas shows a very high content of oxygen species in GO (1:13.6), whereas in RGO, the molar ratio was found to be only 1:2.16, again confirming the successful reduction of GO.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-10-1505">Figure 5</xref> shows the FESEM images of GO and RGO. It could be observed that GO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-10-1505">Figure 5A</xref>) has continuous and smooth wave-like sheets, whereas a flake-like morphology could be noted in RGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-10-1505">Figure 5B</xref>), which forms a disordered solid with the individual sheets closely stacked. With the removal of oxygen groups from the basal plane as well as from the edges of RGO, the graphene sheets were then allowed to closely associate and stack via van der Waals&#x02019; interactions. This finding is in good agreement with the results of XRD obtained for RGO, where the d-spacing or interlayer distance is smaller than GO, permitting the stacking of RGO flakes. The RGO flakes lie flat on top of each other, suggesting the possibility of good electrical contact between them.<xref rid="b59-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> The microstructure of GO and RGO was further investigated by HRTEM. It could be seen that GO has a wavy structure with few well-defined layers of stacking at the edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-10-1505">Figure 5C</xref>). The observed stacking could be due to strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the GO layers or with water molecules.<xref rid="b60-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> As for RGO, thin veil-like sheets were observed with scrolling and wrinkles, which confirms that reduction of GO has taken place. It was reported that scrolling is caused by the presence of isolated epoxy and hydroxyl groups, whereas the wrinkles are due to the removal of strain on the C-C bond in the epoxy groups which was created during the formation of three-membered epoxide rings in GO.<xref rid="b61-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> In addition, RGO appeared transparent, which is similar to the graphene produced from electrolytic exfoliation of graphite as reported by Wang et al.<xref rid="b62-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The lateral dimension of RGO in both FESEM and HRTEM was approximately 500 nm.</p><p>To further confirm the reduction of GO, Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the nature of layering and defects on the graphitic sheets. Generally, the Raman spectra exhibit four main featured peaks: D, G, 2D, and D plus G bands. D band is attributed to the graphene sheet edges and defects, activated by the presence of disorder, whereas the G band originates from the first-order scattering of E2g phonon of sp<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> carbon atoms. The Raman spectra of graphite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-10-1505">Figure 6Aa</xref>) displays a sharp G band at 1,582 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to in-phase vibration of the graphite lattice and a weak D band at 1,370 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> indicating low degree of defects that are mostly due to the sheet edges. In comparison, GO exhibits a prominent G band which is blue-shifted to 1,586 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> signifying the presence of isolated double bonds which resonate at higher frequencies than that of graphite. The intensity of the D band at 1,352 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was also increased which could be attributed to the decrease in size of in-plane sp<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> domains compared to graphite.<xref rid="b12-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b52-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> For RGO, the G band is broadened, shifted to 1,611 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and moved closer to the G band of graphite, which is attributed to graphitic self-healing and successful reduction,<xref rid="b63-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> as the removal of oxygen groups allows the RGO to associate and restack. The D band of RGO becomes more prominent and remains almost at the same position as GO, ie, at 1,351 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>The intensity ratio of D to G is a good indicator of the degree of distortion in the graphitic sheets. As expected, the intensity ratio of RGO has dramatically increased to 0.99 as compared to GO (0.94) and graphite (0.07). A higher intensity ratio as seen in GO compared to graphite is due to the introduction of defects after oxidation of graphite, whereas the highest intensity ratio seen in RGO indicates disorder on the graphene sheets after reduction and an increase in the number of sp<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> domains.

The cross-section from AFM analysis shows that the maximum thickness of GO is approximately 1 nm, which is in compliance with the d-spacing of GO, ie, 0.96 nm as determined by XRD. After reduction, the RGO&#x02019;s thickness is approximately 1&#x02013;2 nm. The thickness obtained is similar to those produced from hydrazine reduced GO<xref rid="b68-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="b69-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> and hydrothermally reduced GO.<xref rid="b61-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Based on the XRD analysis of RGO with 0.37 nm d-spacing, it could be estimated that RGO is few-layered (3&#x02013;5 layers), similar to the observation from Raman analysis.</p><p>The particle size distribution of aqueous dispersion of GO and RGO was determined by DLS analysis. Although DLS is more suitable for spherical particles rather than for planar sheets like graphene, it serves to indicate whether uniformly sized dispersion of graphene was produced, besides demonstrating the changes in the size of GO and RGO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-10-1505">Figure 7</xref>, the average size of GO and RGO was 313 nm and 181 nm, respectively. In GO, the peak appearing after 1,000 nm could be due to the presence of remnants from the reaction of graphite oxidation. Also, the presence of undisrupted long continuous sheets in the GO results in larger size. RGO, however, shows a uniform size distribution with sizes generally at least two-times smaller than GO. This concludes that there is a loss of long-range graphitic order in RGO and corroborates the observation of a D plus G peak in the XRD spectra. The smaller sized RGO observed, as compared to other reported methods,<xref rid="b52-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b70-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> could be mainly due to the method of synthesis employed and due to the effect of 5 minutes of ultrasonication. Reduction of GO with <italic>E. coli</italic><xref rid="b12-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> followed by sonication yields graphene with the size of 702 nm, which is almost seven-times larger than the size of RGO obtained through our strategy. Generally, ultrasonication breaks the RGO nanosheets to smaller fragments; a similar observation was also noted in GO.<xref rid="b71-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> In addition, ultrasonication of RGO results in better dispersion in water. A solubility test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-10-1505">Figure 7</xref>) showed that RGO is stable in the tested solvents for up to 12 months, without any visible aggregation or sedimentation. It is reported that ultrasonic treatment induces cavitation near surfaces of RGO sheets, which inhibits the aggregation of RGO by weakening its van der Waals&#x02019; interactions and, thus, enhances the formation of stable RGO dispersion.<xref rid="b58-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Besides, the presence of oxygen groups at the edges of defects in RGO sheets, as observed in FTIR spectra, could have contributed to the better stability and solubility of the produced RGO.</p><p>Thermal stability of graphite, GO, and RGO was analyzed using TGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-1505">Figure 8A</xref>). GO exhibits much more prominent weight loss as compared to graphite and RGO due to the presence of a larger amount of oxygen groups. Below 100&#x000b0;C, GO has the highest weight loss of about 14.5%, owing to the removal of water molecules, whereas no weight loss was observed for graphite; but a weight loss of 5% could be observed in the case of RGO, which may be due to the removal of adsorbed water molecules. From 100&#x000b0;C to 200&#x000b0;C, GO again had the highest weight loss of about 25% due to the removal of labile oxygen functional groups: CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and possibly remaining water molecules. Weight loss in this region was not observed in graphite, but RGO had a weight loss of approximately 14%, indicating the probable presence of residual GO or water molecules. The highest weight loss was observed from 200&#x000b0;C to 400&#x000b0;C for all three graphitic materials, ie, GO (21%), graphite (1%), and RGO (9%), which is due to bulk pyrolysis of the carbon skeleton. The highest weight loss as seen in GO for this region is due to the complete removal of residual oxygen functional groups. RGO displays better thermal stability as compared to GO due to the comparatively fewer oxygen groups and restoration of weak van der Waals&#x02019; forces between the graphene layers.<xref rid="b54-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p><p>To ascertain whether the followed synthesis method affected RGO&#x02019;s electrochemical characteristics, a CV measurement was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-1505">Figure 8B</xref>). All CV curves were recorded after several cycles of CV and when they became stable. CV of GO/GCE demonstrated almost no electrical potential, with CV curves overlapping those of bare GCE. After reduction, far superior electrical potential was observed for RGO/GCE, with a higher value of current response and CV area. This is largely contributed by an increase in electron transfer in the RGO layer and electronic transition between the RGO layers. The voltammogram for GO showed obvious oxygen and hydrogen evolution peak (indicated by a red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-1505">Figure 8Bb</xref>), whereas the absence of this peak in RGO with typical rectangular curve indicates good charge propagation with electrodes and ideal capacitive behavior.<xref rid="b54-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b72-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></p><p>Previous reports demonstrated that graphene exhibited significant biocompatibility towards numerous cells such as L929 mouse fibroblast cells and A549 human lung cancer cells, and it possessed toxicity only towards a few specific cells.<xref rid="b47-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b73-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> The variation in the cytotoxicity profile is suggested to be mainly due to the difference in the synthesis methods (graphene reduced from GO prepared by modified Hummers method versus graphene from heat treatment of graphite or from unzipping of CNTs).<xref rid="b74-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="b75-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> Hence, for comparison in parallel with GO, the synthesized RGO was subjected to cytotoxicity analysis on two cancer cells (ie, colon [HT-29] and brain [U87MG] cancer cells) to determine the presence of specific cancer type selectivity, as well as on normal cells (MRC-5) to ascertain whether the synthesized graphene material is suitable, especially for anticancer drug-delivery purposes without causing damage to the normal cells.</p><p>Based on the fact that viable cells incorporate and bind more dye as compared to damaged or dead cells,<xref rid="b76-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of GO and RGO can be determined by neutral red uptake assay.

As discussed earlier, this was due to the presence of oxygen functional groups in GO, which consequently lead to oxidative stress in cells and result in poor cell survival.<xref rid="b80-ijn-10-1505" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> RGO showed better cell survival compared to GO for all the three cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values beyond 50 &#x003bc;g/mL and up to 390 &#x003bc;g/mL. Since the cell viability assay was conducted only up to a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/mL, the concentration values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-10-1505">Figure 9D</xref> only serve as an estimation generated by the software. Nevertheless, based on the current findings, our mushroom synthesized RGO, without the need of any functionalization, shows good aqueous stability and is equally biocompatible compared to the functionalized ones. Although our RGO does not possess any selectivity against the two cancer cells and normal cells tested, this feature is still of great value for the synthesized RGO to be a tool for protein/gene transfection, as well as a drug-delivery vehicle for cancer treatment, such as by conjugation of an anticancer drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>An over the counter, commercial-grade mushroom powder was used to effectively reduce GO to RGO with a reaction time of just 1 hour. This environmentally friendly method avoids the use of chemicals and significantly reduces waste, with the advantage of reusability of the extract as a reducing agent. The obtained RGO was readily dispersible in water and was reasonably small, with a thickness of 1&#x02013;2 nm and a 181&#x02013;500 nm lateral dimension. The RGO obtained through this strategy is small as compared to other reported green-synthesis methods. In addition, solubility tests using various solvents showed that RGO is stable up to a tested period of 1 year. The employed synthetic route also did not affect its electrical conductivity. While functionalization of graphene is imperative to reduce its cytotoxicity, the current mushroom-extract-reduced RGO was found to be biocompatible even without any additional functionalization. RGO has not shown any antiproliferative effects towards colon and brain cancer or towards normal cell lines. However, substantial work remains in elucidating this exceedingly good biocompatibility, especially in exploring RGO&#x02019;s intracellular event. The large availability of this mushroom in Asian countries, coupled with ease of preparation, makes this synthetic route lucrative for upscale production. Since there are no toxic chemicals involved or byproducts generated, and it is highly biocompatible towards cells, the produced RGO is suitable for biomedical applications especially in drug-delivery systems, bioimaging, and in biosensing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for the funding
