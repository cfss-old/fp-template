Clostridial toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB) specifically bind to unknown glycoprotein(s) on the surface of epithelial cells in the host intestine, disrupting the intestinal barrier and ultimately leading to acute inflammation and diarrhea. The C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) of TcdA, which is responsible for the initial binding of the toxin to host glycoproteins, has been predicted to contain 7 potential oligosaccharide-binding sites. To study the specific roles and functions of these 7 putative lectin-like binding regions, a consensus sequence of TcdA RBD derived from different <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains deposited in the NCBI protein database and three truncated fragments corresponding to the N-terminal (residues 1&#x02013;411), middle (residues 296&#x02013;701), and C-terminal portions (residues 524&#x02013;911) of the RBD (F1, F2 and F3, respectively) were designed and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In this study, the recombinant RBD (rRBD) and its truncated fragments were purified, characterized biologically and found to have the following similar properties: (a) are capable of binding to the cell surface of both Vero and Caco-2 cells; (b) possess Toll-like receptor agonist-like adjuvant activities that can activate dendritic cell maturation and increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines; and (c) function as potent adjuvants in the intramuscular immunization route to enhance immune responses against weak immunogens. Although F1, F2 and F3 have similar repetitive amino acid sequences and putative oligosaccharide-binding domains, they do not possess the same biological and immunological properties: (i) TcdA rRBD and its fragments bind to the cell surface, but only TcdA rRBD and F3 internalize into Vero cells within 15 min; (ii) the fragments exhibit various levels of hemagglutinin (HA) activity, with the exception of the F1 fragment, which demonstrates no HA activity; and (iii) in the presence of alum, all fragments elicit various levels of anti-toxin A-neutralizing antibody responses, but those neutralizing antibodies elicited by F2 did not protect mice against a TcdA challenge. Because TcdA rRBD, F1 and F3 formulated with alum can elicit immune protective responses against the cytotoxicity of TcdA, they represent potential components of future candidate vaccines against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>-associated diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the grants from National Science Council (NSC 101-2320-B-400-012 and NSC 101-2923-B-400-001-MY3) and National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan, ROC.

Thus, CDI often results in <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>-associated diseases (CDAD), such as diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the past two decades, CDI has become a serious emerging infectious disease worldwide due to a significant increase in multi-drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the discovery of a hyper-virulent and antibiotic-resistant epidemic strain, NAP1/027, in developed countries poses a major challenge for CDAD prevention [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More importantly, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> relapse is approximately 15&#x02013;35% within a few weeks despite standard CDI therapy employing either vancomycin or metronidazole [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The pathogenicity of CDI is largely correlated to the clostridial toxins, toxin A and toxin B (TcdA and TcdB), that are secreted in the gastrointestinal environment of infected hosts and disrupt epithelial cell barriers in the small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both toxins consist of a holotoxin with multi-functional domains that mediate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> pathogenesis. The mechanism underlying TcdA and TcdB toxicity involves three steps: (a) binding to an unidentified receptor protein(s) on the surface of the intestinal epithelium and internalization through its C-terminal receptor-binding domain, (b) auto-cleavage and translocation of the N-terminal glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol from the endosomal membrane; and (c) use of the N-terminal enzymatic region to inactivate the Rho GTPase family via glycosylation [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The published literature has indicated that TcdA-specific antibodies in patient sera positively correlated with the prevention of CDAD recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, passive immunization with anti-toxin antibodies has been shown to confer protection against CDI in murine models, and TcdA-specific monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, different <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> vaccine strategies are being evaluated; the most advanced strategy is vaccination with formalin-inactivated toxins [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135045.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Immunization using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> toxins as the antigen in formulation with different adjuvants has been shown to elicit toxin-neutralizing antibody responses and protect mice against toxin or bacteria challenges [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The RBD is predicted to have a molecular size of approximately 100 kDa and is composed of 32&#x02013;38 homologous repetitive peptides, depending on the sequence analysis [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Based on the crystal structure, the RBD was predicted to consist of 32 short repeat and 7 long repeat carbohydrate-binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The specific roles and functions of the 7 putative carbohydrate-binding regions are unclear, but they correlate to the binding of the oligosaccharide Gal&#x003b1;1-3Gal&#x003b2;1-4GlcNAc [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Greco et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was the first to localize carbohydrate binding to the junction of 2 short repeats and a long repeat. The TcdB RBD has approximately 530 amino acids and 4 putative oligosaccharide-binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, among <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains deposited in the NCBI database, the amino acid sequences of the putative oligosaccharide-binding sites between TcdA and TcdB were found to share approximately 50 to 70% similarity [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To this end, we rationally designed two novel immunogens based on these putative oligosaccharide-binding sites of TcdA RBD and TcdB RBD to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies against both toxins. The biochemical and immunological functions of the TcdB RBD have been characterized and published [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, a recombinant TcdA RBD (rRBD) containing a consensus sequence of TcdA RBD identified from different <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains deposited in the NCBI protein database and three fragments corresponding to the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal parts of RBD (F1, F2 and F3, respectively) were designed and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The purified TcdA rRBD and its fragments were characterized biologically to establish a platform to study the specific roles and functions of the 7 putative receptor-binding regions. Mouse immunogenicity studies were performed to investigate the potential of the rRBD and/or its fragments as components of candidate vaccines against CDAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Center of the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI).

The purification process for TcdA rRBD and its fragments is briefly described below. Cells from 2 liters of culture medium were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20&#x000b0;C before re-suspension in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 250 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole). The cells were physically disrupted using a French Press (Constant System, Daventry, UK) at 27 kpsi, and the supernatant was collected by filtration through a 0.22-&#x003bc;m filter. The crude extract was directly applied onto a nickel affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) for purification of TcdA rRBD at 4&#x000b0;C. After sequential washes with a low concentration of imidazole buffer, TcdA rRBD was eluted using a lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The eluent was then dialyzed in a 30-kDa cut-off dialysis bag against phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol. To remove bacterial endotoxin, the TcdA rRBD solution was passed through an E membrane (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). All purification steps were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE.

Varying amounts of TcdA rRBD were added to the wells, and PBS was used as the negative control. After a 30-min incubation, the wells were washed twice with cold PBS. Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) (Millipore, Billerica, MA), a strong cell lysis buffer, was added to the cells. The total cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Pall Corporation) pre-soaked in methanol. PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS and sequentially exposed to 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL TcdA-specific monoclonal antibodies (Clone PCG-4; GeneTex, Taiwan) and 50 ng/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to a secondary antibody (GeneTex) to detect the amount of TcdA rRBD bound to Vero cells. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk (w/v). PVDF membranes were washed twice at every step with PBST (1&#x000d7; PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature.

These findings support the notion that F3 specifically binds to the cell surface, is internalized into the cytosol, and is cleaved into fragments by lysosomal degradation. After a 15-min incubation, F2 exhibited weak confocal immunofluorescence signals, which suggested that some F2 entered the cytosol (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Conversely, after 30 min of incubation (and even after 75 min), F1 exhibited very weak confocal immunofluorescence signals, which suggested that little F1 entered the cytosol (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). To confirm that the cellular uptake was receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis, chlorpromazine (CPZ) was used and found to inhibit TcdA rRBD and F3 internalization, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0135045.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.

Therefore, TcdA rRBD was tested for its ability to promote the maturation of DCs. BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice were treated with increasing amounts (0.3 to 10 &#x003bc;g) of TcdA rRBD. Cell surface biomarkers associated with DC maturation (CD-40, CD-80, CD-86, and MHC-II) and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL12, and TNF-&#x003b1;) were examined using FACS analysis and cytokine-specific ELISA, respectively. To preclude the interference of LPS contamination, TcdA rRBD samples used in the current studies had very little LPS contamination (0.03 EU/&#x003bc;g of protein). In addition, polymyxin B was added to the DC samples to prevent activation by LPS through the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway. Surface biomarkers of DC maturation were up-regulated, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL12, and TNF-&#x003b1;) increased in a dose-dependent manner from 0.5 to 6 &#x003bc;M (data not shown). A 2-&#x003bc;M TcdA rRBD concentration in the final assay solution was selected for subsequent analyses. Both DC maturation biomarkers were up-regulated (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A to 6D</xref>), and a significant increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL12, and TNF-&#x003b1;) was detected in TcdA rRBD-treated BMDC culture supernatant (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A to 7C</xref>).

The receptor-binding activities obtained from both the Vero/Caco-2 cell-binding assays and FACS analysis (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A to 3D</xref>) provide direct and strong evidence that TcdA rRBD and its fragments (rRBD, F1, F2 and F3) are correctly folded (<xref rid="pone.0135045.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). These results are consistent with other reports showing that the fragments of RBD containing 5 to 15 short repetitive sequences could form stable folded &#x003b2;-solenoid secondary structures [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A novel finding in the present study is that F1, which contains the first three LR sites, may consist of a unique receptor-binding domain that (a) binds to Vero and Caco-2 cells but is not internalized and (b) does not agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes but still has the ability to activate DC maturation and induce anti-TcdA neutralizing antibody responses.

Its rapid internalization properties suggest that F3 could serve as a non-toxic carrier for new drug or vaccine delivery systems with important pharmaceutical applications. F2 possesses lower biological and immunological activities, indicating that the 8 amino acid changes in LR sites #3 (367V&#x02192;G; 380H&#x02192;D; 381N&#x02192;A; 394K&#x02192;E) and 5 (618D&#x02192;N; 629H&#x02192;D; 630N&#x02192;A; 699Y&#x02192;S) may be important for the biological and immunological properties of the RBD. Based on the results, these changes (i) affected and reduced the binding between F2 and the monoclonal antibody PCG-4 (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), which recognizes an epitope located within the F2 fragment [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; (ii) might have decreased F2 cell-binding activity (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>) and HA activity (<xref rid="pone.0135045.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); and (iii) certainly influenced the quality of the functional antibodies induced by F2 in the animal immunogenicity study in which F2 elicited no protection against TcdA (VPI10463 strain) challenge (<xref rid="pone.0135045.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The Vero and Caco-2 cell-binding assays with FACS indicated that TcdA rRBD and its fragments possess different binding activities, and as shown in <xref rid="pone.0135045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, the TcdA-specific monoclonal antibody PCG-4 recognized F2 the least. To eliminate the antibody binding affinity problem, FACS analyses were repeated with an anti-His tag antibody, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). This result confirmed that the Vero and Caco-2 cell-binding activities are as follows: F3&#x0003e;F2&#x0003e;F1 (see the insert in <xref rid="pone.0135045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p>The HA assay reflects the binding activities of each TcdA rRBD fragment to rabbit erythrocytes. Our current results further demonstrate that the N-terminal (F1) and middle (F2) regions of TcdA rRBD exhibit no or poor HA activity in rabbit erythrocytes. Because F1 has no HA activity and did not internalize after cell binding, F1 will be an excellent choice for the identification of specific cell receptor(s). In addition, we hypothesize that the putative carbohydrate-binding sites LR1/LR2 in F1 and LR6/LR7 in F3 bind to different ligands on the cell surface and may amplify receptor-binding affinity through a multivalent ligand mechanism. Therefore, F1 and F3 should be further truncated to investigate the specific roles and functions of the 7 putative receptor-binding sites of RBD.</p><p>TcdA, TcdA RBD and cholera toxin have been shown to possess mucosal adjuvant activity [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135045.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135045.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The present study has demonstrated that TcdA rRBD and its fragments can individually act as potent adjuvants in the intramuscular immunization route to enhance immune responses against OVA. We also clearly show that 2 &#x003bc;M of either TcdA rRBD or its truncated fragments is sufficient to promote the maturation of BMDCs and increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figs <xref rid="pone.0135045.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135045.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

TcdA rRBD and its fragments have exhibited different levels of adjuvant activity in DC activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. F1 and F2 represent low DC activity, but they alone still possess strong adjuvant activity to elicit anti-RBD antibody responses and enhance immune responses to OVA through a T-cell bystander mechanism. Therefore, the DC activity of the TcdA rRBD fragments may not be the only route to modulate the immune system. Additionally, several reports have shown that TcdA can modulate various immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

The TcdA rRBD and/or rRBD fragments only induce partial protection in the TcdA mouse challenge model. These differences in protection levels can be explained by the following reasons. One is that other regions in TcdA are important and involved in protection against the toxin in the mouse challenge model and may be required for vaccine development. Another reason is that the amino acid sequences of immunogens (TcdA rRBD and its fragments) are derived from the 027 strain and are different from the challenge VPI 10463 strain. Thirty-three amino acid changes within RBD (<xref rid="pone.0135045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) may be sufficient to influence the induction of a protective functional cross-neutralizing antibody response. In addition, a low dosage (10 &#x003bc;g) of TcdA rRBD and its fragments was used in the present study compared to other previous reports, in which different dosages, adjuvants, immunization routes and/or vectors were used and could result in different levels of protection in the toxin mouse challenge model [<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
