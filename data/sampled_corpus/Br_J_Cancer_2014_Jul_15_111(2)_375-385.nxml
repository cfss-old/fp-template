Advances in hyperpolarised <sup>13</sup>C-MRS using dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) have further enabled real-time measurements of the kinetics of a range of important endogenous enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2006b</xref>), such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), either <italic>in vitro</italic> in suspensions of viable whole cells or in tumours <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ward <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Previous studies using hyperpolarised <sup>13</sup>C-MRS have shown significant decreases in lactate-to-bicarbonate ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) and pyruvate-to-lactate exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seth <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) in tumour models following 24-h treatment with DCA. Apparent pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate constants (<italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub>) have been shown to decrease following drug-induced depletion of the cofactors NAD(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Day <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and have been shown to be dependent on NAD&#x0002b;/NADH ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christensen <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and the expression and activity of LDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ward <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) as well as on the activity of members of the monocarboxylate transporter family (MCTs), which mediate pyruvate and lactate transport into and out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cells with impaired apoptosis pathways may be resistant to DCA. In this study, we investigate potential non-invasive biomarkers of response following DCA treatment and during recovery from treatment, evaluating the cellular and metabolic effects of DCA on cancer cells that are able to undergo apoptosis (HCT116 wild-type (WT) and HT29 colorectal carcinoma cells, PC3 prostate carcinoma cells) and a cancer cell line that lacks this ability (HCT116 Bax-ko cells that are deficient in the protein Bax; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we observed minimal apoptosis or necrosis in all the cell lines but instead observed induction of autophagy and increased expression of LC3B II in all the cell lines following 24&#x02009;h of DCA treatment. Induction of autophagy was also found in DCA-treated HT29 xenografts. We observed increased ROS production and mTOR inhibition (as demonstrated by the reduction in the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1), suggesting that they have a role in the induction of autophagy following DCA treatment in these cell lines.</p><p>The measured lactate excretion into the culture media was reduced after DCA treatment, returned to control levels following recovery in HCT116 Bax-ko cells and exceeded control levels in recovered HCT116 WT cells. Significant reductions in the apparent forward rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> (and associated increased NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratios and NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels in cells) were observed following DCA treatment in all the cell lines as well as in HT29 xenografts. Significantly higher <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub>, NADH and NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels were found following 48-h recovery from DCA treatment in HCT116 Bax-ko cells when compared with controls.

Previous publications have shown that <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> is sensitive to a number of factors, including changes in LDH activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Day <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ward <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), the availability of the enzyme co-factor NAD(H), NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Witney <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christensen <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and changes in substrate concentration, for example, the endogenous concentration of lactate, as well as modulation of monocarboxylate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In our experiments, we observed increases in the NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio and in NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in DCA-treated HT29 and HCT116 Bax-ko cell lines, which are consistent with the observed drop in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub>.</p><p>The observed increase in NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio following DCA treatment in our experiments is consistent with enhanced mitochondrial complex 1 activity leading to increased oxidation of NADH generated during glycolysis and the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Santidrian <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The reduction in the Warburg effect during DCA-induced autophagy and PDK inhibition by DCA treatment could result in more pyruvate being diverted to the TCA cycle and a reduction in lactate excretion. Enhanced TCA cycle activity during autophagy may also lead to less reliance on aerobic glycolysis in autophagic cells with cellular homeostasis maintained by utilising autophagic degradation products to fuel cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rabinowitz and White, 2010</xref>). This is consistent with the NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio returning to control levels following recovery from DCA-induced autophagy in HCT116 Bax-ko cells. Our data are consistent with the known inverse relationship between lactate/pyruvate ratios and NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williamson <italic>et al</italic>, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christensen <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> rate constant has a strong linear correlation with lactate/pyruvate ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Witney <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2013b</xref>), and therefore a reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> would be consistent with a decreased lactate/pyruvate ratio and an increased NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio. Previously, we have also demonstrated a significant reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> and an associated increase in NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio in autophagic cells in which autophagy had been induced by 24&#x02009;h of PI103 treatment (<italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> reduced to about 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of control; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin <italic>et</italic> al, 2014</xref>). The magnitude of these changes is similar to the changes that we observed in DCA-treated HCT116 Bax-ko cells without the addition of DCA to the final cell suspensions.</p><p>The mean decreases in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> in DCA-treated HCT116 Bax-ko cells were greater (68&#x00025;) with DCA added to the final cell suspension mixture compared with 44&#x00025; without DCA added to the suspension media, indicating that the combined effect of PDK inhibition and/or DCA-induced autophagy is about 44&#x00025; and that the competitive inhibition of MCT-1 contributes an additional decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> of about 24&#x00025;. This difference in the measured rates suggests that high concentrations of DCA can competitively inhibit the MCT-1 transporter. This would elicit a further additive effect, by slowing pyruvate entry into the cell and cause a further drop in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> in DCA-treated cells. Interestingly, both MCT-1 expression and activity of LDH were increased in DCA-treated cells, in contrast to the observed drop in <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub>, and these changes suggest that the cells may be compensating for the combined effects of PDK and MCT-1 inhibition due to DCA treatment by upregulating MCT1 expression and LDH activity.</p><p>We have also examined the longitudinal effect on the measured <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> in DCA-treated cancer cells undergoing autophagy and during their subsequent cellular recovery. The apparent rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> was higher than control in the group that had recovered from DCA treatment and was associated with recovery of cell numbers to higher than control, and with a sustained increased MCT-1 expression and concentration of NADH, which would enable increased influx of pyruvate into the cell and increased turnover of hyperpolarised substrates in the cytosol. Total lactate excretion in cells recovering from DCA-induced autophagy returned to or above the level of 24-h vehicle-treated controls, indicating that the cells had also recovered from the metabolic effects of DCA-induced autophagy. Similar cellular and metabolic changes were also observed in HCT116 Bax-ko cells recovered from PI103-induced or amino acid and serum deprivation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that DCA-induced autophagy was reversible in our experiments.</p><p>DCA is currently in clinical trial (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01111097">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01111097</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michelakis <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our study showed that DCA can induce autophagy in cancer cells and tumours and that this effect is independent of the cells' ability to undergo apoptosis. Our findings may have important implications for the use of DCA as a single anti-cancer agent, as the induction of autophagy by DCA could potentially be experienced by patients in the clinic. Treatment outcomes will be very different in tumours that are undergoing apoptosis <italic>vs</italic> autophagy, as cells may recover from autophagy, thus prolonging their survival in hostile environments, aiding recovery once the stress is removed and promoting resistance to cancer treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that DCA treatment increased ROS production, inhibited the mTOR pathway and induced autophagy in prostate and colorectal cancer cells and xenografts. Further studies are required to examine whether the increased ROS production and/or mTOR inhibition contribute to DCA-induced autophagy. Reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> and lactate excretion were seen in DCA-treated cells and xenografts, and this may be due to the mechanism of drug action of DCA (PDK and MCT-1 inhibition) and/or the autophagic process. Further studies are required to determine how DCA induces changes in molecular signalling pathways and whether these changes are caused by the alterations in cellular metabolism (downstream of PDK inhibition) or <italic>vice versa</italic>. Increased <italic>k</italic><sub>PL</sub> and lactate excretion recovered on cessation of treatment indicating that these processes are reversible, which could provide a potential marker of resistance to treatment. The use of hyperpolarised [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and <sup>13</sup>C-MRS may provide a useful method to monitor the effect of DCA on cancer cells and tumours, non-invasively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the support received from the CRUK and EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in association with the MRC and Department of Health (England) grant C1060/A10334, CRUK grant C1060/A16464, also NHS funding to the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Chang Gung Medical Foundation (Taiwan) grant CMRPG370441 and MRC-funded studentship (MRC119X).
