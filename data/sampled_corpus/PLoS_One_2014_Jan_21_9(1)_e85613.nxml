This study aimed to characterize quantitative and qualitative aspects of various T cell subpopulations that do not improve despite effective ART. CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio was evaluated in HIV-infected subjects with viral loads &#x0003e;10,000 copies/&#x000b5;l (&#x0201c;non-controllers&#x0201d;, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42), those with undetectable viral loads on ART (&#x0201c;ART-suppressed&#x0201d;, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;53), and HIV-uninfected subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22). In addition, T cell phenotype and function were examined in 25 non-controllers, 18 ART-suppressed, and 7 HIV-uninfected subjects. CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio in non-controllers, ART-suppressed, and HIV-uninfected subjects was 0.25, 0.48, and 1.95 respectively (P&#x0003c;0.0001 for all comparisons). The increased ratio in ART-suppressed compared to non-controllers was driven by an increase of CD4+ T cells, with no change in the expanded CD8+ T cell population. Expansion of differentiated (CD28&#x02212;CD27&#x02212;CD45RA+/&#x02212;CCR7&#x02212;) T cell subpopulations persisted despite ART and minimal changes were noted in na&#x000ef;ve T cell frequencies over time. Increased number of CD8+CD28&#x02212; T cells and increased CD8+ CMV-specific T cell responses were associated with a decreased CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio. Measures of T cell function demonstrated persistence of high frequencies of CD8+ T cells producing IFN&#x02013;&#x003b3;. Lastly, though all CD8+ subpopulations demonstrated significantly lower Ki67 expression in ART-suppressed subjects, CD4+ T cell subpopulations did not consistently show this decrease, thus demonstrating different proliferative responses in the setting of T cell depletion. In summary, this study demonstrated that CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios remained significantly decreased and na&#x000ef;ve T cell numbers were slow to increase despite long-term viral suppression on ART. In addition, there is a evidence of differential regulation of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, suggesting independent homeostatic regulation of the two compartments.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (AI052745 to BE; AI47062 and AI43864 to JMM; and AI055273 and AI44595 to SGD; P30 AI027763 and R24 AI067039 to JNM), amfAR (106710-40-RGRL), the California AIDS Research Center (CC99-SF, ID01-SF-049), and the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (P30 MH62246).

Though the immunologic and clinical benefits of ART cannot be doubted, the degree to which ART can fully &#x0201c;normalize&#x0201d; immune function is less clear. In addition, there remains an increased incidence of non-AIDS events among HIV-infected individuals on ART and the etiology of these events have not been fully elucidated. We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of effectively treated subjects to find that a number of immunologic parameters associated with altered phenotype and dysfunction in individuals with uncontrolled HIV replication are, in fact, only minimally changed with ART, despite long-term suppression of viral replication to undetectable levels. We report here that, despite effective ART, many adults have persistently low CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios driven by expanded CD8+ T cells, limited increases in na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cell numbers and frequency, and a shift in differentiation/maturation status of CD8+ and to less degree CD4+ T cells toward a more differentiated phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent and this research was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>Blood was obtained from individuals enrolled in SCOPE, a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study based at the University of California, San Francisco.

ART-suppressed individuals had a median CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio of 0.481 (p&#x0003c;0.0001 compared to non-controllers and to HIV-uninfected). The higher ratio in the ART-suppressed group compared to non-controllers was due entirely to higher CD4+ T cells counts (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005) with no difference in CD8+ T cell counts (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.82). Thus, despite increase in the CD4+ T cell count and in CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio with antiretroviral treatment, complete normalization of the ratio did not occur due to a persistently expanded population of CD8+ T cells. There was no relationship between the CD4&#x02236;CD8 T cell ratio and the duration of suppression on ART, self-reported duration of HIV infection, or CD4 nadir (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pone-0085613-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085613.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CD4&#x02236;CD8 T cell ratio.</title><p>CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were enumerated among different patient groups.

Each of these findings has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and development of AIDS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. Upon administration of effective ART, peripheral CD4+ T cell counts increase and there is a significant decrease in AIDS-related clinical conditions, but alterations in the distribution and function of certain T cell subpopulations persist. In this manuscript, we confirm findings of larger studies that there is a significant reduction of CD4&#x02236;CD8 T cell ratio in untreated HIV infection with a decrease in na&#x000ef;ve CD4 and CD8 T cells. We additionally show that, in a cohort of effectively treated adults who received therapy for a median of 3.5 years, some aspects of immune phenotype remain unchanged: CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios remain decreased as do na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cell frequency, and there are persistent increases in the circulating number of CD8+ T cells with differentiated effector (CD28&#x02212;) phenotypes. With increased time on ART, it is notable that a subset of individuals experienced appreciable gains in their CD4+ T cell counts and normalization of their CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio; however, the majority did not show continued improvement in this latter parameter. In addition, we demonstrate that the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations demonstrate differential proliferative status within their respective subpopulations. We suggest here that the continued, persistent expansion of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells limits the ability to regain total CD4+ T cells, and na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio.</p><p>The inability to normalize CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios, regain na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cells and the persistent expansion of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells despite the administration of effective ART may be due to one or more contributing forces, including: (1) impairment in production of na&#x000ef;ve T cells; (2) ongoing antigenic stimulation/activation, with continued recruitment into the effector/memory T cell compartment; and (3) altered homeostatic mechanisms. In all these scenarios, substantive and irreversible damage to stromal microenvironments necessary for the maintenance of normal T cell homeostasis may be playing a role.</p><p>With regard to antigenic stimulation, it is likely that low level HIV production persists in tissue reservoirs, even when viral loads are suppressed to undetectable levels in peripheral blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Yukl1">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-dEttorre1">[29]</xref>. Given the strong pro-inflammatory effects that HIV has on the immune system and observations that measurement of HIV persistence correlate with T cell activation, it is possible that ongoing HIV replication contributes to continued, albeit lower, levels of antigenic stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Llibre1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Yukl2">[31]</xref>. In addition, the presence of other pathogens, including cytomegalovirus and gut microbial products, may be an important contributor to chronic T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Brenchley1">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Naeger1">[36]</xref>. We have shown that CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses remain high in ART-suppressed individuals, and that higher CMV-specific responses are associated with a lower CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio. This is consistent with findings by Appay et al showing that higher CMV-specific responses are associated with poor total and naive T cell recovery in ART-treated subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Appay2">[37]</xref>, suggesting that existing highly differentiated CD8+ T cells directed against CMV, and potentially other antigens, contribute to poor T cell reconstitution.</p><p>The role of differential CD4+ and CD8+ T cell turnover was evaluated in this study by measuring proliferative capacity (i.e., Ki67 expression) in naive, memory, and effector T cell subpopulations. In comparison to HIV-uninfected subjects, Ki67 expression is substantially lower in CD8+ T cell subpopulations, but comparable to higher among CD4+ T cell populations, from ART-suppressed subjects. This suggests independent and differential homeostatic regulation mechanisms of the two T cell compartments. This is consistent with the observation that Ki67 levels are very low in the persistently expanded CD8+ T cell population, but slightly higher than normal in the depleted CD4+ T cell compartment. This observation is supported by studies that demonstrate that CD4+ T cell proliferation is driven by both CD4+ T cell depletion and viral load, and whereas CD8+ T cell proliferation is largely driven by viral load alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Catalfamo1">[38]</xref>.</p><p>This study highlighted that despite long-term follow-up of HIV-infected subjects on ART, there is limited full recovery of naive T cell numbers, particularly na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cells and limited recovery of the CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio. A similar observation <italic>has been reported</italic> in the setting of patients with cancer who undergo ablation of T cells with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Fagnoni2">[39]</xref>. In this other clinical situation of profound T cell depletion, CD8+CD28&#x02212; effector T cells rebound most quickly after SCT and to levels higher than prior to chemotherapy. However, even after na&#x000ef;ve T cells begin to emerge, the expanded CD8+CD28&#x02212; population remains the predominant subpopulation of T cells. This analogous clinical situation of profound T cell depletion and CD8+ effector T cell expansion also results in persistently lower CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios and the inability to restore na&#x000ef;ve T cells to normal numbers. We similarly show the persistence of highly differentiated T cells with a CD28&#x02212;CD27&#x02212;CD45RA+/&#x02212;CCR7&#x02212; phenotype with increased IFN-&#x003b3; and decreased IL-2 production, which contribute to a large population of anergic, apoptosis-resistant cells that limits further recovery. Other studies have noted that the CD8+ T cells remain unchanged after ART and are not impacted by class of antiretrovirals used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Khanna1">[40]</xref>. Here, we additionally note that the expanded CD8+CD28&#x02212; T cell population is associated with lower CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios, which suggests that the expansion of CD8+ T cells limits the ability other subpopulations of T cells to fully recover. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085613-g006">Figure 6</xref> illustrates a model how the recovery of na&#x000ef;ve T cells and normalization of the CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio may be impacted by several simultaneously impaired processes.</p><fig id="pone-0085613-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0085613.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schema of CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio in HIV infection.</title><p>Uncontrolled HIV infection results in depletion of CD4+ T cells with concomitant increase in CD8+ T cells, mostly of an effector phenotype. This process is largely driven by high levels of T cell activation. With introduction of antiretroviral therapy, there is a decrease in T cell activation and a resulting drop in activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. There is also some recovery of CD4+ T cells. However, an inverted CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio persists due to persistently expanded CD8+ T cell population.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0085613.g006"/></fig><p>It is of interest that na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cell numbers do not correlate with the CD4+ T cell nadir, length of therapy, duration of HIV infection, or total CD4+ T cell count. The lack of association between these factors and na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cell recovery suggests that the damage done with uncontrolled HIV infection occurs relatively early and that recovery of T cell subpopulations, particularly na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cells, may be impaired regardless of the &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; of disease prior to treatment initiation. The impact of early ART initiation on the recovery of na&#x000ef;ve T cell numbers remains to be seen.</p><p>One consideration for this study is the inability to closely control for other confounding factors in our HIV-uninfected control group that may influence T cell phenotypes: age, gender, co-infections, substance abuse. These analyses should be further explored in well-characterized age-matched cohorts of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. In addition, characterization of T cell responses to neoantigens including those used in vaccinations, and/or tumor antigens may provide further insight into the impact of these immunologic parameters on development of antigen-specific T cell responses.</p><p>The inability for normalization of the CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratio in the majority of individuals on ART may reflect a persistent expansion of CD8+ T cells, particularly those of an effector phenotype and decrease in those with a na&#x000ef;ve phenotype as we have shown. Notably, each of these immunologic characteristics has been associated with advanced aging and accelerated disease progression in elderly HIV-uninfected adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Sansoni1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Fagnoni1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Appay2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Wikby2">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085613-Appay3">[43]</xref>. The clinical correlation of continued immunologic perturbations is thus important to pursue given the importance of na&#x000ef;ve T cell recovery in the defense against new pathogenic infections and tumor surveillance. It remains to be seen whether these persistent deficits portend decreased responses to vaccination and/or serve as a potential etiology for the rise in non-AIDS, age-associated clinical conditions (e.g., increased rates of cancers and of cardiovascular disease) among HIV-infected subjects. Further studies using large cohorts are needed to evaluate the clinical profile of individuals with different immune phenotypes so that these aberrant phenotypes can be validated as biomarkers of clinical risk as well as to better obtain an understanding of the drivers of low CD4&#x02236;CD8 ratios while receiving effective ART.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
