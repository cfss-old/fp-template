Although there is increasing literature regarding the advantages and limitations of both modalities, there is no literature regarding the accuracy of these modalities for diagnosing breast lesions in high-risk patients, who usually have lesions detected by screening. Moreover, few studies have been published regarding the cytopathology of mammary tumors in cats despite widespread use of the animal model for breast cancer formation and inhibition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic interest of cytological and histopathological analysis in feline mammary tumours (FMTs), in order to evaluate its possible value as an animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was performed in 3 female cats submitted to surgical resections of mammary tumours. The mammary tumours were excised by simple mastectomy or regional mastectomy, with or without the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Female cats were of different breeds (1 siamese and 2 persians). Before surgical excision of the tumour, FNA cytology was performed using a 0.4&#x000a0;mm diameter needle attached to a 8&#x000a0;ml syringe held in a standard metal syringe holder. The cytological sample was smeared onto a glass slide and either air-dried for May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald-stain and masses were surgically removed, the tumours were grossly examined and tissue samples were fixed in 10%-buffered-formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thick were obtained from each sample and H&#x00026;E stained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cytologically, atypical epithelial cells coupled to giant nucleus, chromatin anomalies, mitotic figures, spindle shape cells, anisocytosis with anisokaryosis and hyperchromasia were found. Histologically, these tumors are characterized by pleomorphic and polygonal cell population together with mitotic figures, necrotic foci and various numbers inflammatory foci. Also, spindle shaped cells, haemorrhage localized in the different regions, local invasiveness and enlarged nuclei were observed. The samples included 3 tumors of mammary glands mammary tumors were complex carcinomas (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and adenocarcinoma (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). The histological grades of the 3 cases were as follows: grade II, (1/3); grade III, (2/3) with high mitotic index. The preferential localization of mammary neoplasms was in the inguinal lobe (1/3 case) and abdominal lobes (2/3 cases). Furthermore, 1case of the inguinal mass affected the left caudo-inguinal lobe and 2cases right cranio and caudo abdominal lobes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study concluded that cytology could be used as a quick, rapid, field diagnostic technique in combination with histopathology for the diagnosis of feline mammary tumors (FMTs). Our findings in feline MTs indicate that FMTs could be useful as an animal model of human breast cancer. Moreover, because of the similarity of the cytohistopathological findings in the human and feline mammary gland tumours, it is possible to use the same cytopathological criteria applied in human pathology for the diagnosis of feline mammary gland tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Virtual slide</title><p>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/2047361423103295">http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/2047361423103295</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pathology</kwd><kwd>Cytology</kwd><kwd>Cats</kwd><kwd>Mammary gland</kwd><kwd>Tumours</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is the most frequent occurring tumor in humans. Mammary tumours (MTs) are among the most common neoplasms in both cats and dogs, but the prevalence of malignant histological types is far higher in cats (ratio of malignant: benign is at least 4:1). Feline MTs comprise approximately 11% of feline non-integumentary neoplasms, are more commonly malignant than benign, and carry a poor prognosis attributable to a high probability of local recurrence and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Feline mammary complex carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are one of the most common feline neoplasms and represent an important cause of mortality. The incidence and the morbidity of these tumors have been demonstrated to be very high because their biologic behavior is characterized by rapid growth, high proliferation rates, and capability to metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>MTs are commonly observed in female cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Between 80% and 96% of these tumors are malignant and very aggressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], MTs are an important cause of mortality, especially in middle-aged and elderly females. The interval between feline mammary carcinoma detection and death varies from &#x0003c;6 to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several factors, including age, diameter of the primary lesion, the presence of histologically tumor-positive lymph nodes, mitotic count, extent of necrosis, and complete surgical excision, are independently correlated with post-surgery survival time.</p><p>A number of new methods are therefore tested within tumor pathology to improve the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. To make a diagnosis, a number of clinical and paraclinical tests are used because it is essential to find the most aggressive malignant tumors that need radical surgery and supplementary treatment as soon as possible. After excision, a hematoxylin-eosin stain is often used to provide a histopathological diagnosis, but even though this is performed by experienced pathologists, the disorderly structure of some mammary tumors may cause confusion and may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a method largely used to obtain samples for cytological diagnosis in several organs. When applied to mammary gland lesions, the method shows good diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, it is a simple, rapid and low cost method, with minimal risk for the patien [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In veterinary medicine, the use of cytology as a diagnostic method is very recent and has been growing in the last 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite this copious literature, there have been few reports of mammary tumors in feline. Retrospective reports have described the epidemiologic characteristics, gross morphology, and microscopic features of both benign and malignant mammary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks information on the cytohistopathological profile of mammary tumors in this species. The present study was designed to morphologically and cytopathologcally describe spontaneous mammary gland tumors in cat. We also considered the usefulness of tumor grading as a prognostic indicator.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Characterization and clinical features of cases</title><p>Three cats were undergone surgery at the Department of Veterinary Clinic, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, from July 2012 to April 2013 were initially included in the study.

Mammary neoplasias are the third most frequent neoplasias in cats, accounting for 12% of all feline tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Fine needle aspiration cytology of the breast has a high range of accuracy (72&#x02013;99%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], in the diagnosis of malignancy and its sub typing. Despite this, some rare lesions create problems at cytodiagnosis. Accuracy of cytodiagnosis of malignant breast tumors is very important to know the exact line of treatment preoperatively. Histologically, 25&#x02013;30% of epithelial malignancies are in the group of specialized breast carcinoma like lobular, papillary, apocrine, tubular, cribriform, medullary, mixed, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In order to deciding the best type of treatment, sub typing of breast tumors using aspiration cytology is useful. If tumors are of low malignant potential, options for conservative breast carcinoma treatment are being available for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is not always possible to label the exact subtype on aspiration cytology without correlating the clinical and histopathological findings. We performed a validity study to further characterization of sensitivity and specificity values as well as the accuracy of FNA cytology in the diagnosis of feline MTs.</p><p>In some studies, the fine needle aspiration cytology specimens contained many individual bizarre, multi-nucleated, and/or giant cells having hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and relatively abundant cytoplasm, admixed with numerous mitotic figures in a hemorrhagic or inflammatory background in human. A small amount of sheet-like or three-dimensional clusters of malignant cells coexisted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found 100% cytological and histological diagnostic agreement. These results are similar when compared with results of studies of human breast lesions published by Choi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and Ciatto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. They described high levels of agreement between cytological and histological diagnoses, ranging from 64.8% to 74.1%. In addition, when the authors excluded the inconclusive cases, their level of agreement increased to 93.1 and 96.7%, respectively. The results were at variance with findings of Bofin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], who reported 84.6% of correlation between cytological and histological diagnoses of mammary tumours.</p><p>Histopathologic examination was considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of feline MTs. The histological analysis of feline MTs usually includes a spindle cell component Haziroglu et al., 2010, present spindle shaped cells reported in one case of malignant mixed tumour and in one case of complex carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, spindle shaped cells were encountered in one case of complex carcinoma in accordance with previous reports.</p><p>Histologically, carcinomas differed from benign mammary tumors in at least one of the following features: atipia in the epithelial component of the tumor growth, infiltrative growth, high mitotic activity and cellularity, and/or necrosis. In general, the malignant mammary gland tumors were mostly well or moderately differentiated. In current study, features of anaplasia such as bizarre mitotic figures, an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and hyperchromatic nuclei were observed in our feline MACs.</p><p>Our histological findings resembled those included in the World Health Organization&#x02019;s classification of mammary tumors of the dog and cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other authors have used this classification system to classify mammary tumors in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In effect, we believe that pathologists and clinicians should routinely use this system to standardize, interpret, and accurately reproduce research results. In our study, all tumors were malignant, 2 were complex carcinoma (case Nos. 1 and 2), and also, 1 case was a adenocarcinoma (case No. 3).</p><p>Neoplastic, multinucleated giant cells are common cell type in feline carcinomas and adenocarcinoma and are associated with tumors of a high histologic grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Considering these results in present study, neoplastic, multinucleated giant cells may be an important source of malignant factor that could increase the growth of carcinomas. These results, together with the pleomorphic cellular appearance, indicate a poorly differentiated tumor, in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>A histologic grading system, based on assessing the degree of tubule formation, mitotic activity, and nuclear pleomorphism, has been used for canine and feline mammary carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The histologic grade of malignancy is determined by the sum of individual scores for these features and is of prognostic significance. Through the use of this system, the masses in the current study were categorized as moderately and poorly grade. The low-grade malignancy and the lack of evidence of infiltration correlate well with the slow clinical progression in these cats.</p><p>This study supports the previously reported lack of correlation between survival period of cats with their age, breed, sex, or type of surgical excision of the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The age of affected cats, gross appearance of the tumors, as well as prevalence of benign versus malignant mammary tumors in this study were similar to those in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The present study supports the previously reported higher prevalence of adenocarcinoma in abdominal mammarylobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, some authors have reported that abdominal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] are more commonly affected by tumors, whereas others have found inguinal lobes to be involved more often [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study described some clinical-cytopathologic features of 3 cats with histologic features that correspond to feline MACs of the mammary gland in women. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the clinico-cytohistopathologic features of these tumors type in Siamese and Persian feline mammary glands in Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>All cases of feline MACs of the mammary gland herein reported were associated with clinical-cytopathologic features of high biologic aggressiveness and low survival rate and should be classified as an independent histologic type of FMAC. These results also suggest that FMAC, on the basis of histologic and clinical outcome, it is a good animal model to study women's breast cancer.</p><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the local animal care committee in accordance with undergone surgery at the Department of Veterinary Clinic, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, from July 2012 to April 2013 were initially included in the study and office regulations.
