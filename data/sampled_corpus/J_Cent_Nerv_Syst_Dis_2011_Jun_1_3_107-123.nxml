Long acting injections are important alternatives to oral medications for patients who have difficulty adhering to daily or multiple daily medication administrations, yet may be underutilized or not well understood. Patient perceptions, adherence, and preferences are important issues for health care providers to address when discussing treatment options with their patients. Reviewed here are overall patient and health care provider attitudes and perceptions regarding long acting injections and the details of olanzapine long acting injectable, the newest agent, and how it will fit in the marketplace. In addition, efficacy, safety, dosing and use data regarding this newest long acting agent are reviewed and compared to other available long acting agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>long acting injectable</kwd><kwd>olanzapine</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>patient perspective</kwd><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The availability of second generation antipsychotics (SGA) as long-acting formulations has been eagerly anticipated, as data regarding the adherence rates of oral SGA do not appear strikingly different from adherence rates of oral first generation antipsychotics (FGA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jcnsd-3-2011-107">1</xref> Lack of illness insight, challenges to adherence and the risk of relapse may lead to significantly decreased functioning and quality of life in schizophrenia, thus, the use of long-acting antipsychotics are emerging options to ensure stable levels of medication dosing.</p><p>Although these new formulations appear to be viable treatment options for symptom control in patients with schizophrenia, the use of these agents is not as prevalent as may be expected or as seen in other countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jcnsd-3-2011-107">2</xref> There are various reasons for this, including attitudes and preferences of patients as well as health care providers.

Olanzapine pamoate&#x02019;s pharmacologic activity includes antagonism of dopamine (D) and serotonin (5HT). Antipsychotic activity is thought to be achieved through the D and 5HT2 antagonism. Olanzapine binds with high affinity to 5HT2A/2C, 5HT6, D1-4, and adrenergic &#x003b1;1 receptors, and with moderate affinity to 5HT3 and muscarinic M1-5.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jcnsd-3-2011-107">3</xref></p><p>This article begins with a review of the importance of the availability of long-acting injectables (LAI), including the effects on adherence and relapse, and also discusses patient and health care providers&#x02019; attitudes and perspectives regarding the use of LAI.

Rittmanns berger and colleagues (2004) reported that of 95 consecutive patients hospitalized for a psychotic disorder, 57% reported being partially or fully nonadherent in the month prior to admission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-jcnsd-3-2011-107">13</xref> In fact the risk of relapse has been found to be 3.7 times greater for nonadherent schizophrenia patients as compared to those who adhered to their pharmacologic treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-jcnsd-3-2011-107">14</xref> Long acting injections (LAI), as discussed below, are means of dose delivery that ensure adherence, and therefore may be potentially advantageous agents in improving relapse risk for certain patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Impact of Long Acting Injectable (LAI) Antipsychotics on Relapse and Adherence</title><p>Long acting injection medications are dosing formulations that alleviate the potential for patients to stop taking or even moderate their prescription antipsychotic usage without the knowledge of the prescriber. These formulations were first developed in the 1960s, and offer the advantages of constant antipsychotic delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jcnsd-3-2011-107">15</xref> Many studies have shown that LAI may reduce rehospitalization rate and relapse in people with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jcnsd-3-2011-107">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jcnsd-3-2011-107">17</xref> A meta analysis of LAI antipsychotic use found a statistically significant advantage for LAI in global improvement compared to oral agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jcnsd-3-2011-107">18</xref> In addition, a subsequent meta-analysis calculated a one-year relapse rate of 27% for LAI antipsychotics compared to 42% for oral medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jcnsd-3-2011-107">17</xref> A recently published systematic review and meta analysis of oral and LAI antipsychotics and their effects on relapse in long term trials is now published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jcnsd-3-2011-107">19</xref> This paper utilized data from 10 studies and found significantly fewer relapses among people taking depot as compared to oral antipsychotics (21.6% vs. 33.3%). While not all data support the advantages of LAI in relapse as compared to oral, this recent review suggests that this method of delivery is likely to improve long term relapse rates in schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jcnsd-3-2011-107">20</xref> Despite improving relapse, few published studies are available to support the advantage of LAI vs. oral agents on medication adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jcnsd-3-2011-107">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jcnsd-3-2011-107">21</xref> The prescription of a LAI may not ensure adherence, as patients may still miss clinic appointments, however, surveillance of nonadherence becomes simplified, as covert nonadherence (skipping doses, or cheeking medications) may be prevented. Nonadherence is estimated to occur in about one quarter of patients with schizophrenia treated with LAI agents (range 0%&#x02013;54%),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jcnsd-3-2011-107">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jcnsd-3-2011-107">23</xref> which is likely lower than oral medication nonadherence rates.</p><p>It is important to note that many variables influence adherence to treatment and follow-up care and little work is published on the outcomes and attitudes on medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia who have been treated with LAI antipsychotics. Also of note clinician ratings of adherence and patient ratings of adherence may not be measuring the same dimensions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jcnsd-3-2011-107">24</xref> Furthermore physicians and patients may not even measure the antipsychotic adverse effects similarly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-3-2011-107">25</xref> More research is needed to better understand patient perspectives and opinions on strategies and treatments that may better improve adherence to pharmacologic treatments. The following sections explore the issues surrounding prescribing and acceptance of LAI, both from prescriber and patient perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Prescribing of Long Acting Injectable Antipsychotics</title><p>Prescribing of LAI medications tends to occur in challenging and more chronic patients despite the potential advantages of using earlier in the illness phase. Few treatment na&#x000ef;ve patients are given long acting injections as efficacy and tolerability to oral medications may be more safely and easily established. In a study examining LAI preferences and attitudes, Heres and colleagues (2007) found that patients currently prescribed LAI medications were older than patients never prescribed LAI, but had been younger at first hospitalization and had been more frequently hospitalized in the past.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-107">26</xref> Nonadherence is not always a factor leading to the use of LAI. Only 18% of patients were prescribed LAI in a recent study, although up to 49% of this sample had significant adherence issues in a past one year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jcnsd-3-2011-107">27</xref> One three&#x02014;year study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jcnsd-3-2011-107">28</xref> found only 12% of patients recently nonadherent on oral antipsychotics were initiated on LAI. This study also reported that patients initiated on LAI agents were more likely to be hospitalized at initiation or the previous 30 days, to have recent involvement with the criminal justice system, recent illicit drug use, recent switching or augmentation of oral antipsychotics, and recent treatment with oral typical antipsychotics as compared to those initiated on oral treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jcnsd-3-2011-107">28</xref> The fact that more challenging, longer duration of illness, and nonadherent patients are prescribed LAI may introduce challenge in accurate study of this population and the effectiveness of these agents.</p><p>Stigma has also surrounded injectable antipsychotics particularly in the US as other countries utilize LAI more widely.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jcnsd-3-2011-107">29</xref> In addition, the difficulty with specific, reliable dose conversions between oral and injections, and the complicated pharmacokinetic patterns of injections, have led to the potential of prescribing too much or too little medication. Inconsistent dosing may put patients at risk of either efficacy shortfalls or increased side effect burden. With the advent of second- generation antipsychotics, the use of FGA long acting injections decreased. More recently however it is being recognized that SGA effectiveness with treatment and adherence may not be strikingly better than the FGA use and emerging literature with the introduction of new SGA LAI suggests a resurgence in interest in these dosage formulations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jcnsd-3-2011-107">30</xref> Some clinicians report that LAI are underutilized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jcnsd-3-2011-107">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jcnsd-3-2011-107">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-3-2011-107">32</xref> The use of long acting agents, however, should take into account the perspectives, attitudes, preferences and beliefs of the patients we treat and the associated health care providers to ensure the optimal use of these agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-3-2011-107">33</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Health Care Professional Perspectives on LAI Antipsychotics</title><p>There is little data published to date on the perspectives and attitudes of health care professionals on newer LAI antipsychotics. However, since various health care professionals often play a role in antipsychotic selection, the attitudes and perspectives of health care professionals are important in the prescription and success of use of LAI.</p><p>A wide international and regional variation in both utilization of and attitudes/perspectives regarding LAI among health care professionals has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jcnsd-3-2011-107">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jcnsd-3-2011-107">35</xref> Patel and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jcnsd-3-2011-107">35</xref> reported that the majority of community mental health nurses in a UK study note that their patients played a role in antipsychotic selection (79%), and they reported favorably of their role on administration of LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jcnsd-3-2011-107">35</xref> However in this study about one third of the nurses believed that LAI were old fashioned, about 40% felt they were stigmatizing and coercive, and about one quarter of those surveyed felt that LAI compromised patient autonomy. Another study in Hong Kong also reported that health care professionals generally had positive perceptions of their role in administration, however, they reported perceptions of less favorable patient opinions regarding LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-3-2011-107">33</xref> Negative views expressed on LAI use included the perception that most patients preferred oral medications and that force may be required for administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-3-2011-107">33</xref></p><p>Other reports suggest that health care professionals believe that LAI are not acceptable to patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jcnsd-3-2011-107">36</xref> LAI agents are only offered to about one third of all eligible patients with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jcnsd-3-2011-107">37</xref> However, a survey of schizophrenia patients prior to hospital discharge reported that only 30% of the sample would have refused LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-107">26</xref> Therefore, acceptance rate may be higher than the perceptions of patient acceptance by the health care team and higher than actual prescription rates.</p><p>Different health care disciplines may have different attitudes and perceptions due to their differing medical training and differing relationships with patients and their symptoms (prescribers, nurses, social workers, psychologists, etc.). Lambert and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jcnsd-3-2011-107">38</xref> reported that nursing and allied health professionals were more likely than medical staff to consider variables such as weight gain, injection site reactions, and patient preferences when prescribing LAI. In a systematic review of eight relevant studies, the attitudes of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, community mental health nurses, and other mental health professionals (nurses, psychologists, social workers, etc.) were assessed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-jcnsd-3-2011-107">39</xref> Factors that led to opposing the use of LAI included side effects, cost, the inability to abruptly discontinue, presumed adherence to oral medications in patients, and the professionals&#x02019; perception of patient preference. In addition, a positive correlation has been found between attitudes toward LAI and extent of knowledge about the medication formulations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-3-2011-107">33</xref> A recent study examined psychiatrists&#x02019; attitude of using LAI in first episode schizophrenia and concluded that there is little specific reasons noted for not prescribing in this population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jcnsd-3-2011-107">40</xref> It should be noted that most studies examining health care professional perceptions were published prior to the availability of second-generation injectable medications. In fact, data indicate psychiatrists noted their willingness to prescribe more LAI if there were fewer side effects, or if SGA were available in long acting form.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jcnsd-3-2011-107">36</xref></p><p>Therefore it appears that health care providers should be well informed as to the risks and benefits of long acting injectables and knowledge of these agents is critical for improving success. More work is needed to better understand how the new LAI entering the marketplace are accepted and if perspectives and attitudes are now changing. In order to help improve knowledge on the second generation agents entering the marketplace we review the newest agent below and compare to the other newer long acting agents. We also consider and review what is known about patient perspectives as ultimately the patient needs to be aware of the benefits and risks, have a choice in the prescription and have the support of the team and others such as the family to help make informed and good choices.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Perspectives on Prescribing of Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics</title><p>Involving patients with schizophrenia in the decision making process with the health care team may be challenging due to the inherent nature of psychosis and potential lack of insight. Many patients feel they are not involved sufficiently in treatment decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jcnsd-3-2011-107">41</xref> Fortunately in recent years there has been an increase in shared decision making in severe mental illness as joint education and choices may lead to a process that enhances recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-jcnsd-3-2011-107">42</xref> Recent data suggests that shared decision making may have positive outcomes on relapse prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-jcnsd-3-2011-107">43</xref> For example, data suggest a trend for fewer hospitalizations in a chronic inpatient population that participated in shared decision making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-jcnsd-3-2011-107">44</xref> It is felt that incorporating shared decision making into antipsychotic prescribing will improve outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-jcnsd-3-2011-107">45</xref> and it is important to have an understanding of what motivates choice-making in patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jcnsd-3-2011-107">41</xref></p><p>Heres and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-107">26</xref> explored the subjective rationale for LAI treatment in schizophrenia patients with past or current experience with LAI. Of the 300 patients included, 95 (32%) had been treated with LAI in the past and 20% were currently on LAI. Approximately 46% of these patients with current or past experience indicated that they were prescribed long acting medication for its reliable efficacy, 45% reported taking for convenience, 26% were taking because they often forgot to take their oral medication, and 24% were taking because the medications has better side effect profiles and improved their quality of life. In this study, including those currently, previously, and never treated with LAI, the majority of patients (54%) agreed it was more convenient to receive an injection every two to four weeks compared to taking tablets on a daily or multiple-daily dose regimen. Approximately 43% thought the injection was preferred for preventing relapse, 40% saw injections as away of putting more distance between themselves and their illness, and 35% saw benefit of potential lower antipsychotic dose. Schizophrenia patients currently treated with LAI formulations recognized the benefits most often, followed by those previously treated with LAI and then those never treated with LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-107">26</xref></p><p>It is important to note that published reports suggest that some patients do view LAI as coercive. Nineteen percent of patients in the Heres et al study noted their experience with LAI agents as compulsory measures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-107">26</xref> Patel and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-jcnsd-3-2011-107">46</xref> examined patient&#x02019;s perspectives (N = 72) of coercion (defined as perceived by the patient, not legal detention status) regarding oral and long acting antipsychotic medication. Total coercion scores, perceived coercion and negative pressure subscales, were significantly higher for LAI antipsychotics compared to oral medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-jcnsd-3-2011-107">46</xref> It should be noted, however, that the population currently more likely prescribed LAI are often more chronic and have existing adherence issues. In a recent study, 46% of outpatients with current or previous LAI experience felt they were forced to start treatment with long acting agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-3-2011-107">33</xref> despite literature suggesting favorable attitudes toward LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jcnsd-3-2011-107">36</xref> The following section will address patient preferences and attitudes of LAI and oral antipsychotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Preferences and Attitudes Regarding Long Acting Injectables Compared to Oral Agents</title><p>Many times, prescribers assume that patients will not want to accept a LAI if they are stabilized on an oral medication. Not all data, however, support this view. Wistedt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-jcnsd-3-2011-107">47</xref> reported that roughly 60% of patients switched from oral antipsychotics to LAI formulations stated they felt better, and preferred the LAI formulation to the oral. In addition, a review of the published literature of patient and nurse attitudes toward LAI showed that five of six studies reviewed demonstrated patient preference and high acceptance to the LAI agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-jcnsd-3-2011-107">47</xref> Endorsement of LAI in patients currently taking these formulations has ranged from 23 to 93% (median 61%). However, these data were focused among schizophrenia patients who attended regular injection clinics.</p><p>Not all reports show patients favoring LAI. For example, Castle and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-jcnsd-3-2011-107">48</xref> reported that the long acting injection group (FGA) had the highest rate of persons rating medications as unhelpful, with those lacking insight to their illness rated medications lower. Bradstreet and Norris<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-jcnsd-3-2011-107">49</xref> found that 43% of persons who had used LAI rated them as unhelpful while 38% rated them as helpful. About half of the patients rated LAI helpful for specific issues such as symptom relief.</p><p>Preference of antipsychotic formulation has been found to be related to prescribed formulation that patients were taking at the time of asking about preferences. Patel and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-jcnsd-3-2011-107">50</xref> reported that LAI antipsychotics were preferred by 43% of those currently prescribed them, while LAI preference was only demonstrated by 6% of those currently taking oral medications. Those patients currently taking oral medications preferred their current formulation, but those taking current LAI formulations were indifferent. This outpatient study found that current prescribed formulation (LAI or oral) predicted preference to treatment but did not predict the attitude of the patient to treatment. Attitudes were more influenced by illness duration, extrapyramdial side effects and insight. Twenty-four percent of the patient sample felt embarrassed or ashamed to attend the clinic for medications regardless of being on LAI or oral, and 21% of those surveyed stated there was more reason to feel embarrassed or ashamed if someone was taking a LAI as compared to oral medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-jcnsd-3-2011-107">50</xref></p><p>There have been a few recent studies reporting on attitudes and perceptions of second generation LAI. A recent study reported the results of switching stable patients with schizophrenia from LAI and oral antipsychotics to risperidone LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-jcnsd-3-2011-107">51</xref> In this nonrandomized study patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders reported statistically significant improvement in both patient satisfaction and quality of life at endpoint. The proportion of patients who rated risperidone LAI treatment as &#x02018;very good&#x02019; increased from 10% to 40%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-jcnsd-3-2011-107">51</xref> Likewise, high patient satisfaction was reported in a 12 week double blind clinical trial of risperidone LAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-jcnsd-3-2011-107">52</xref> However, not all data have been positive.

This paper found that the olanzapine treated patients had significantly higher percentage of patients reporting positive attitude on Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) items compared to the other medications, including haloperidol (6 items), risperidone (2 items), and ziprasidone (1 item).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-jcnsd-3-2011-107">56</xref> In this study, patients with positive attitude toward medications had a greater likelihood of treatment completion, and on items of the DAI-10, patients reporting positive attitude toward treatment had significantly higher completion rates than did those reporting negative attitudes. In addition, patient favorable attitudes toward current treatment were also associated with improvements in symptom severity. Although this study utilized oral rather than depot formulations, it is of note that olanzapine performed better than other antipsychotics in at least one item of DAI in comparison with each comparator.</p><p>Thus, in summary, patient perspectives and attitudes are critical and need to be evaluated by the health care team in order to address potential issues, and to and help patients understand what LAI medications can offer. Many patients once satisfactorily treated with LAI prefer being on this treatment for the long term. Unfortunately, to date there is no research guiding clinical teams on the preferences and attitudes of the newest class of LAI antipsychotics (olanzapine pamoate, risperidone microspheres and paliperidone palmitate) and decisions remain largely based on health care team input. Yet, the largest paper to date on oral medication reported the highest treatment satisfaction scores with olanzapine compared to a host of other agents. This is despite some of its pitfalls such as weight gain and metabolic complications. While this may not be translated into the same findings in long acting it is important to review this new medication in the long acting form to know its risks and benefits for both the health care team and the patients themselves.</p></sec><sec><title>Olanzapine Pamoate Long Acting Injection: A New Choice in LAI Preparations</title><p>Olanzapine pamoate is a long acting injection formulation of olanzapine, and is the newest LAI available for use in patients with schizophrenia.

Olanzapine pamoate should be given as deep intramuscular gluteal injection only with a 19-guage, 1.5 inch needle, or larger if patient is obese. In order to receive the olanzapine pamoate LAI in the US, the prescriber, patient, facility, and pharmacy must all be enrolled in the Zyprexa Relprevv Patient Care Program. The Patient Care Program has been developed in order to increase monitoring of patients after administration of OLAI. In addition to the boxed warning regarding death in elderly patients that accompanies the oral formulation, a boxed warning regarding Post-Injection Delirium Sedation Syndrome (PDSS) has been added. This warning indicates the possibility that patients are at risk for severe drowsiness, unconsciousness, coma, confusion, and disorientation after each injection and must stay at the doctor&#x02019;s office or clinic for at least 3 hours after the injection is given.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jcnsd-3-2011-107">3</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Dosing Recommendations for Olanzapine LAI</title><p>Dosing recommendations for Olanzapine LAI have been developed both from occupancy studies and from relapse data from clinical trials.

By the fifth injection cycle the D2 occupancy resembled baseline oral olanzapine (84%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-jcnsd-3-2011-107">60</xref></p><p>The dosing recommendations may be found on <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jcnsd-3-2011-107">Table 1</xref>. After initial use of olanzapine oral formulation to establish tolerability, olanzapine pamoate may be initiated. A two-step dose prescribing system is recommended in the olanzapine long acting injectable labeling due to the delay in reaching steady state. This involves using a higher dose or increased duration of injection for the first 8 weeks, followed by either a decrease in dose or duration once steady state is established. Dose regimens range from 150 mg every 2 weeks, to 300 mg every 4 weeks, to 210 mg every 2 weeks, to 405 mg every 4 weeks, to 400 mg every 2 weeks. Doses in excess of 405 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 2 weeks have not been evaluated. For a goal of reaching 10 mg oral equivalent, for example, it is recommended to give 210 mg every two weeks or 405 mg every four weeks for the initial 8 weeks of treatment. After the eighth week, dosing may progress to a maintenance dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg every 4 weeks. For a goal of 15 mg/day equivalents, initiate with 300 mg every two weeks for the first 8 weeks. After the first 8 weeks of treatment, the dose may be adjusted to 210 mg every 2 weeks or 405 mg every 4 weeks. For a goal of 20 mg olanzapine day equivalents, there is only one dose recommended, and no adjustment at week 8.

A recent presentation reported a comparison of completion rates of olanzapine pamoate and risperidone microspheres from open label single arm completed studies. Twelve-month completion rates for olanzapine and risperidone were 72.9%&#x02013;81.5% for olanzapine and 47%&#x02013;59.1% for risperidone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87-jcnsd-3-2011-107">87</xref> However, differences in study designs and populations make these results difficult to generalize or to use for drawing definitive conclusions. Head to head efficacy studies are needed to determine whether significant differences exist between the long acting agents.</p><p>Despite little comparison data, side effects in addition to the preparation and initial dosing differences of these medications often play a role in health care provider selection. Olanzapine pamoate is associated with similar side effects to oral such as weight gain and some elevations in lipid parameters. Risperidone and paliperidone are associated with weight gain but lesser than olanzapine. These agents do have elevations in prolactin and may cause hormonal dysregulation and sexual dysfunction to a greater degree. Risperidone may be associated with more extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) than olanzapine at the higher doses. Thus, in conclusion among the agents, important differences to help guide selection would be the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Oral antipsychotic coverage (Needed for risperidone not olanzapine and paliperidone)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reconstitution (Needed for risperidone and olanzapine not paliperidone)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Refrigeration (Needed for risperidone not olanzapine and paliperidone)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient care registry (Needed for olanzapine not risperidone and paliperidone)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Two dose initiation (Needed for paliperidone not olanzapine or risperidone)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Less than monthly injection (Needed for risperidone not paliperidone or certain dose schedules of olanzapine)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Side effects (more weight gain with olanzapine, more EPS (higher doses) and prolactin elevations with risperidone.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, adherence and relapse are frequent problems in people with schizophrenia. Long acting injectable antipsychotics may offer benefits over oral agents particularly in the prevention of relapse. Perspectives and attitudes of health care providers and patients are mixed but generally favorable but these agents remain underutilized. It appears that better understanding and education may lead to wider use. It may be that the newer class of second generation antipsychotics that are available in long acting formulation may be perceived by health care providers and patients as a more desirable treatment option however this remains unknown. Olanzapine pamoate LAI is the newest addition to the available long acting options to treat patients with schizophrenia. Both acute and maintenance efficacy in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on oral medications prior to switching to injection has been demonstrated in published and unpublished clinical trials. Although no head to head comparisons to other long acting injections exist, olanzapine long acting is similar in efficacy to oral olanzapine. Despite its efficacy, the perceived cost of the injection, as well as the restriction of use to patients enrolled in the Patient Care program, may limit the use of this medication. However as adherence continues to be a significant problem in schizophrenia, LAI may offer an important treatment option and a more convenient way to ensure ongoing antipsychotic treatment. More research is needed to best understand the benefits of LAI, the hurdles and barriers that prevent more widespread use, cost effectiveness analyses and personalized treatment strategies as to which patients may be best candidates for treatment. Nonetheless, this next generation of people treated with LAI will hopefully benefit more integrated and knowledgeable health care teams regarding long acting agents and from increased shared decision making and patient input to avoid the downfalls and pitfalls of past long acting injection treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-jcnsd-3-2011-107"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>This manuscript has been read and approved by all authors.
