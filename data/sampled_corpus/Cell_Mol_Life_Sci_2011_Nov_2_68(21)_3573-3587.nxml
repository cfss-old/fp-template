Here we observed that a selective agonist of the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP4, ONO AE1-329, potently attenuated the chemotaxis of human peripheral blood eosinophils, upregulation of the adhesion molecule CD11b and the production of reactive oxygen species. These effects were accompanied by the inhibition of cytoskeletal rearrangement and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization. The involvement of the EP4 receptor was substantiated by a selective EP4 antagonist, which reversed the inhibitory effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> and the EP4 agonist. Selective kinase inhibitors revealed that the inhibitory effect of EP4 stimulation on eosinophil migration depended upon activation of PI 3-kinase and PKC, but not cAMP. Finally, we found that EP4 receptors are expressed by human eosinophils, and are also present on infiltrating leukocytes in inflamed human nasal mucosa. These data indicate that EP4 agonists might be a novel therapeutic option in eosinophilic diseases.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00018-011-0642-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Eosinophils</kwd><kwd>Prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>Receptors</kwd><kwd>Chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>Reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>Degranulation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Basel AG 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eosinophils play a major role in late-phase reactions by releasing bronchoconstrictor mediators such as leukotriene (LT) C<sub>4</sub> and other chemoattractants that cause further influx of inflammatory cells into the tissue, and immunoregulatory type-2 cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Mucosal damage in chronic asthma is associated with cytotoxic mediators that are released by activated eosinophils, including matrix metalloproteases, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, leading to airway remodeling and angiogenesis in chronically inflamed tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Importantly, it was shown that asthmatic patients who receive treatment based on eosinophil counts in sputum have significantly fewer severe asthma exacerbations than patients treated according to standard management therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, eosinophils are currently considered a major therapeutic target in allergic diseases and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], eosinophilic esophagitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], colitis ulcerosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], or hypereosinophilic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> is the predominant cyclooxygenase (COX) product of airway macrophages, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, and is regarded as a potent inflammatory mediator due to its effects on vasodilation, vascular permeability, and nociception. However, the role of PGE<sub>2</sub> in allergic inflammation is less clear. In the asthmatic lung, PGE<sub>2</sub> affects both airway smooth muscle and the inflammatory process: PGE<sub>2</sub> causes bronchial relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and inhibits allergen-induced bronchoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but it may also provoke bronchoconstrictor responses and cough in some individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] because of activation of C-fibers and reflex cholinergic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In rats and humans, PGE<sub>2</sub> reduces allergen-induced airway eosinophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], attenuates anaphylactic mediator release from guinea-pig perfused lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], abrogates eosinophil accumulation after passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Conversely, eosinophil influx is exaggerated in COX-1 or COX-2 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and also in mice treated with selective COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At the cellular level, PGE<sub>2</sub> has been found to attenuate immunoglobulin-dependent degranulation and LTC<sub>4</sub> biosynthesis of eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and agonist-induced CD11b upregulation and <sc>l</sc>-selectin shedding in eosinophils and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast, PGE<sub>2</sub> is anti-apoptotic for eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while its analogue misoprostol inhibits eosinophil survival in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The biological effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> are mediated through four different G protein-coupled heptahelical receptors, termed EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Each of these receptors has a distinct pharmacological signature based on its selectivity towards synthetic PGE<sub>2</sub> analogs and intracellular signal transduction. Stimulation of the EP1 receptor results in G<sub>q</sub>-mediated activation of phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, and causes the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The EP3 receptor exists as a number of splice variants displaying various degrees of constitutive activity. EP3 signals through activation of a G<sub>i</sub> protein to inhibit adenylyl cyclase leading to reduction of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation and elevation of intracellular-free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. However, isoforms of EP3 also have the capacity to enhance cAMP formation by coupling to G<sub>s</sub> protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In contrast, stimulation of EP2 and EP4 receptors usually increases intracellular cAMP levels and activates protein kinase A (PKA) through G<sub>s</sub> protein. Interestingly, EP2 receptor stimulation can also trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in a cAMP-dependent/PKA-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>We recently described that stimulation of EP2 receptors attenuates eosinophil trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and we also obtained some preliminary information on a potential role of EP4 receptors in the regulation of eosinophil function. Therefore, in this study we investigated the expression, function, and signaling of EP4 receptors in eosinophils in detail and suggest that EP4 receptors are even more substantially involved in the regulation of eosinophil effector functions as compared to EP2 receptors. EP4 agonists might hence be novel therapeutic options for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p>All laboratory reagents were from Sigma (Vienna, Austria), unless specified.

Interestingly, we found that peripheral blood eosinophils also express EP1 and EP3 receptors, as suggested previously for eosinophils recovered from sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]; the role of these receptors in eosinophil function is still unclear.</p><p>EP4 receptors were also detectable on infiltrating leukocytes, presumably eosinophils, in inflamed human nasal mucosa, and also in murine lungs after allergen exposure (data not shown). In contrast, EP4 receptor expression was confined to the epithelium in the lungs of control animals. These data suggest that the amelioration of airway eosinophilia as observed after administration of PGE<sub>2</sub> in humans and in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] might be mediated by EP4 receptors. Therefore, our data might provide the rationale for the evaluation of systemically available EP4 agonists in models of inflammation.</p><p>Stimulation of EP4 receptors usually increases intracellular cAMP levels. Interestingly, it seems that the inhibitory effect of EP4 receptor activation does not depend on activation of the adenylyl cyclase/PKA pathway, as the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of ONO AE1-329 on eosinophil migration. The effectiveness of SQ22536 as an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor was demonstrated by the fact that SQ22536 prevented the attenuation of eosinophil migration induced by PGI<sub>2</sub>, a known stimulator of adenylyl cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Stimulation of EP4 has been shown to cause phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) through a PI3K-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Additionally, the existence of an alternative EP2/EP4 signaling pathway, linked to PKC activation has been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine on eosinophil migration in the presence of the EP4 receptor agonist ONO AE1-329. In fact, inhibition of PI3K prevented the inhibition of eosinophil migration induced by ONO AE1-329. Moreover, exposure of eosinophils to the selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine prior to stimulation of the EP4 receptor with ONO AE1-329 resulted in almost complete reversal of the attenuation of eosinophil chemotaxis. Since these data implicated PKC as a negative regulator of eosinophil migration, we investigated the effect of the PKC activator PMA on eosinophil migration. As expected, PMA very potently mimicked the inhibitory effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> and the EP4 receptor agonist on eosinophil migration. The inhibitory effect of PMA, however, could not be prevented by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Therefore, our data indicate that both PI3K and PKC are involved in the attenuation of eosinophil migration upon EP4 receptor activation and confirm previous data that modulation of PI3K mediates the inhibitory effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> in neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>Chemoattractants like PGD<sub>2</sub> or eotaxin are known to elevate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in eosinophils, which is an essential requirement for effector functions like degranulation and respiratory burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Hence, we investigated the influence of PGE<sub>2</sub> on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization induced by these chemoattractants. Our data show that PGE<sub>2</sub> inhibits chemoattractant-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in eosinophils, and what is more, that this effect is mediated via EP4 receptors. This conclusion was based on the observations that the selective EP4 agonist ONO AE1-329 likewise inhibited eosinophil Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and that this effect was reversed in the presence of the selective EP4 receptor antagonist ONO AE3-208. In contrast, the PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced attenuation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in eosinophils was not mimicked by the IP/EP1 receptor agonist iloprost, the EP2 receptor agonist butaprost, or the EP1/EP3 receptor agonist sulprostone. Another important prerequisite for chemoattractant-induced eosinophil migration, oxidative burst, and degranulation is the rapid reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which results in a shape change of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Similar to our observation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization we found that PGE<sub>2</sub> inhibits shape change of eosinophils solely by EP4 receptors, since inhibition of shape change could also be evoked with ONO AE1-329 but not with iloprost, butaprost, or sulprostone. This notion was supported by the fact that inhibition of eosinophil shape change induced by PGE<sub>2</sub> or ONO AE1-329 was reversed by the EP4 receptor antagonists ONO AE3-208 and GW627368X in a similar fashion.</p><p>Interestingly, neither chelerythrine nor LY294002 was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of the EP4 agonist on Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and shape change (unpublished observation), suggesting that the roles of PI3K and PKC are largely restricted to EP4-mediated inhibition of chemotaxis. This notion complements our finding that both EP2 and EP4 activation curtails eosinophil chemotaxis, while only EP4 controls shape change, Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, and production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, a detailed analysis of EP4-related signaling needs to be carried out for each eosinophil function separately in future studies.</p><p>Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and shape change are important requirements for eosinophil adhesion, respiratory burst, and mediator release, we investigated the consequences of reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses by PGE<sub>2</sub> with regard to these eosinophil effector functions. Indeed we found that the eotaxin- and PGD<sub>2</sub>-induced stimulation of CD11b expression was negatively modulated in the presence of PGE<sub>2</sub> in eosinophils, and that this effect could be mimicked by the EP4 receptor agonist ONO AE1-329. In contrast to other adhesion molecules, cell surface expression of CD11b is rapidly increased on leukocytes after stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-integrin CD11b/CD18 (also referred to as CR3, Mac-1, or &#x003b1;<sub>m</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>) is an important complement receptor that binds multiple ligands, including C3bi, ICAM-1, fibrinogen, and &#x003b2;-glucan. Apart from adhesion, CD11b/CD18 is an important modulator of further leukocyte responses, including migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], respiratory burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], degranulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. CD11b expression on circulating eosinophils is significantly elevated in various allergic disorders, including atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Therefore, upregulation of surface CD11b closely reflects eosinophil activation and might be a prerequisite of leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation, by mediating the release of eosinophils from bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and their migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. These observations suggest that the reduced CD11b response in the presence of PGE<sub>2</sub> might have a profound impact on eosinophil functions, such as migration to sites of allergic reactions, degranulation, and oxidative burst. In agreement with this notion, we were able to show that PGE<sub>2</sub> and the EP4 receptor agonist ONO AE1-329 attenuate the formation of reactive oxygen species with remarkably high potency, while the EP2 agonist butaprost had no effect. Therefore, it appears that the PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced attenuation of eosinophil oxidative burst is also mediated via the EP4 receptor rather than the EP2 receptor. This notion was further asserted by the EP4 receptor antagonist ONO AE3-208 and GW627368X, which reversed the inhibition of reactive oxygen species production by PGE<sub>2</sub> and ONO AE1-329.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that eosinophils express EP4 receptors and activation of EP4 receptors negatively modulates eosinophil migration and respiratory burst. Furthermore, we were able to show that PI3K and PKC are involved in the inhibitory effect of EP4 receptors. In previous studies it was shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> has bronchoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties but the usefulness of PGE<sub>2</sub> as a therapeutic agent is limited because of its various side-effects such as acute bronchoconstriction, retrosternal soreness, transient cough, and flu-like symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While the latter effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> are thought to arise from EP1 or EP3 receptor stimulation, selective EP4 agonists might have more favorable pharmacological profiles. Therefore, EP4 agonists might be a useful novel approach in the treatment of eosinophilic diseases as they not only attenuate chemoattractant-induced eosinophil migration and degranulation, as EP2 receptor agonists do, but also abolish other eosinophil effector functions such as upregulation of adhesion molecules or production of reactive oxygen species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e1695" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
