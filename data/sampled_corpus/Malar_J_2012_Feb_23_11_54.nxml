Pharmacological activity of this drug is attributed to its ability to inhibit PfHSP90. The parasite growth arrest has been shown to be due to drug-induced blockage of the transition from ring to trophozoite stage. To further evaluate the consequences of this pharmacodyamic feature, the anti-malarial activity of GA analogs with enhanced drug properties in a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected animal model have been evaluated for their capacity to induce clearance of the parasite. In the process, a hypothesis was subsequently tested regarding the susceptibility of the cured animals to malaria reflected in an attenuated parasite load that may be evoked by a protective immune response in the host.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Six weeks old Swiss mice were infected with a lethal <italic>Plasmodium yoelii </italic>(17XL) strain. On appearance of clinical symptoms of malaria, these animals were treated with two different GA derivatives and the parasite load was monitored over 15-16 days. Drug-treated animals cured of the parasite were then re-challenged with a lethal dose of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL. Serum samples from GA cured mice that were re-challenged with <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL were examined for the presence of antibodies against the parasite proteins using western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL infected mice with GA derivatives showed slow recovery from clinical symptoms of the disease. Blood smears from drug treated mice indicated a dominance of ring stage parasites when compared to controls. Although, <italic>P. yoelii </italic>preferentially invades normocytes (mature rbcs), in drug-treated animals there was an increased invasion of reticulocytes. Cured animals exhibited robust protection against subsequent infection and serum samples from these animals showed antibodies against a vast majority of parasite proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with GA derivatives blocked the transition from ring to trophozoite stage presumably by the inhibition of HSP90 associated functions. Persistence of parasite in ring stage leads to robust humoral immune response as well as a shift in invasion specificity from normocytes to reticulocyte. It is likely that the treatment with the water-soluble GA derivative creates an attenuated state (less virulent with altered invasion specificity) that persists in the host system, allowing it to mount a robust immune response.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic></kwd><kwd>Geldanamycin</kwd><kwd>Immunity</kwd><kwd>Normocyte</kwd><kwd>Reticulocyte</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A recent WHO factsheet lists that in 2008, there were about 225 million cases of malaria and nearly 800,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These deaths are largely due to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>infection among young children from sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates about the reported deaths due to malaria in other regions of the world are highly uncertain and are likely to be much greater than the documented ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Observation that the repeated exposures to parasite in endemic regions can lead to development of immunity has stimulated intensive efforts to search for protective antigens to develop vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In last half a century, a variety of strategies involving immunization with different stages of parasite has thus far not culminated in any successful vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. At present, malaria is curable, but excessive and non-compliant use of anti-malarial drugs, have resulted in the emergence of drug resistance that has spread very rapidly, eliminating the effectiveness of some of these drugs to cure the disease (for example chloroquine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is an urgent need to develop a new class of anti-malarials that can target pathways and processes distinct from the existing therapeutic agents. In the last decade, <italic>Plasmodium </italic>genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has greatly increased the repertoire of potential drug targets and possibilities for structure based rational drug design approaches to explore and develop novel anti-malarials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, time tested approaches of screening compound libraries in cellular assays have yielded very promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A naturally occurring benzoquinone ansamycin compound, geldanamycin (GA) is a specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and is a potential anti-cancer agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As the life cycle of <italic>Plasmodium </italic>requires two different hosts of which one is poikilotherm and other is a homeotherm, it is not surprising that a significant fraction of parasite genome (~2%) is dedicated to molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As heat shock proteins are critical for maintaining a functional complement of proteins in the parasite, proteins like HSP90, HSP70/HSP40 and other smaller HSPs have been the major drug targets for anti-malarials. The blockade of HSP90 function by geldanamycin (GA) has been reported to inhibit the growth of the malarial parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>in in vitro cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Using synchronized cultures of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, Bhanumathy et al. observed that the geldanamycin treatment (24 h) causes specific blockade of the transition from ring to trophozoite stage in the life cycle of the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the contrary, Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported that the treatment of an asynchronous culture of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>3D7 with geldanamycin resulted in inhibition of all intra-erythrocytic stages and the parasites were destroyed in a single developmental cycle. Such a death and disintegration led to the appearance of pyknotic bodies in the GA treated cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Irrespective of these discrepancies, it is clear that GA is effective in inhibiting the growth of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>in in vitro cultures of chloroquine sensitive (strain 3D7) as well as resistant (strain W2) strains. Thus, it appears to be a good candidate to develop as a novel class of anti-malarial.</p><p>In past, attempts have been made to develop geldanamycin as an anti-cancer drug. However, due to its low aqueous solubility and high hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], efforts were directed towards development of more water soluble and metabolically stable derivatives of GA. A synthetic analogue of geldanamycin, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) has been through phase-I trials for cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This experimental drug was found to have acceptable levels of hepatotoxicity. The growing evidence regarding the potential for useful anti-malarial activity by these experimental therapeutic agents and their derivatives warrants continued pre-clinical evaluation. To date, there has been no experimental work reported on the evaluation of the efficacy of geldanamycin-derivatives in curing malaria in animal model systems. This investigation was undertaken to test the anti-malarial activity of 17-AAG and a highly water soluble geldanamycin derivative, 17-N-(3-(2-(-2(3-aminopropoxy)ethoxy)propyl)pent-4-ynamide-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-PEG-Alkyn-GA) in an animal model system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Chloroquine phosphate was a kind gift from BDH Industries LTD., Mumbai, India.

It is likely that this change in invasion specificity renders the parasite benign and may contribute, in part to why the host system eventually succeeds in clearance of the pathogen.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>infected mice with geldanamycin (17-AAG and 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA) resulted in change in invasion specificity of the parasite from normocytes to reticulocytes</bold>.

In each smear, rings, trophozoites and schizonts were counted and plotted as the percent of total infected cells. Data are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. In the control group of mice, initially (1-3 days post infection), most parasites are in the ring stage. With time, there is a gradual decrease in the ring population with concomitant increase of trophozoites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), suggesting constant transitions of rings to trophozoites. However, on treatment with 17-AAG or 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA on day 6 post infection, population of rings increased and stabilized at much greater fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, day 7-10 post infection) as compared to the control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Such a distribution can arise if there is a blockade or reduction in transition from ring to trophozoite stage. The profile of stage specific distribution of the parasites was rather similar for the both the geldanamycin derivatives used (17-AAG or 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA). These observations are in agreement with the conclusions arrived at by Bhanumathy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] where it was demonstrated that GA blocks the progression of rings into trophozoites in in vitro cultures of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. In the blood smears examined here, pycnotic bodies were never observed. Thus, it is unlikely that there is any large scale death and disintegration of the parasite in response to GA treatment as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment with 17-AAG and 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA of infected mice showed blockage of ring to trophozoite transition</bold>.

To test this hypothesis, the mice that were cured by GA-derivative drug treatment were allowed to recover and live a healthy life for 30 days and then challenged with a fresh dose of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL. For comparison, second group of mice that had been cured from malaria symptoms by treatment with chloroquine and allowed to recover for 30 days, were also challenged for the second time. To ensure that the parasite is lethal, a control set consisting of four fresh na&#x000ef;ve mice was also included. Parasitaemia profiles in these three groups of mice were monitored daily and are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. As expected control mice had high parasitaemia (40-60%) that resulted in their death between days 5 to 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The group treated with geldanamycin derivatives showed very low parasitaemia (&#x0003c; 4%) that peaked on day 2 and got cleared by day 9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Chloroquine-treated mice had intermediate profile with parasitaemia reaching around 8-13% that did clear by day 16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Average parasitaemia profiles of these three groups are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>. These results suggest that mice treated with HSP90 antagonists developed a robust immunity against subsequent challenge with the parasite.

HSP90 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone critical for the folding, assembly and activity of the signaling proteins that promote the survival and the growth of dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Binding of GA to HSP90 results in dissociation of chaperone-client protein complexes and induces the degradation of client proteins. It is believed that such destabilization of client proteins (like raf, Src, Lck, Wee1, Mek, Cdk4, Src, Ck2, Akt, ErbB2 etc.) is responsible for the anti-mitotic and anti-tumor activity of the drug. As geldanamycin is highly hepatotoxic, a less toxic derivative of geldanamycin, 17-AAG was tested in Phase-I clinical trials as an anti-tumor agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>As homologs of mammalian HSP90 are present in most pathogens, there is a possibility of GA emerging as a broad spectral anti-parasitic agent. Effects of inhibiting the functional activity of HSP90 using geldanamycin have been investigated on few pathogens. In <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, it is known that transition from insect stage promastigote to pathogenic mammalian stage, the amastigote is triggered by the rise in ambient temperature. Inactivation of HSP90 by GA mimics the temperature-induced differentiation from promastigote to amastigote. However, GA treatment of cultured promastigotes induced a growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Macro-filaricidal activity of GA against cat and dog filaria has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Recent observations about the ability of GA to kill adult male and female worms of <italic>Brugia malayi </italic>(that causes lymphatic filariasis] and <italic>Schistosoma japonicum </italic>(that causes schistosomiasis) suggests possibilities of wider therapeutic potential of this drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. GA resistant homolog of HSP90 has been reported in nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] raising the possibility for the quick emergence of resistance against the drug.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, anti-plasmodial activity of geldanamycin has been investigated using <italic>Plasmodium </italic>cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the experiments reported here, these studies have been extended to an animal model and tested the anti-malarial potential of this drug. The two derivatives of geldanamycin (17-AAG &#x00026; 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA) that were tested here, show anti-malarial activity and injection of two doses of 300 nmoles each per mouse were sufficient to clear the parasites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Detailed examination of distribution of parasites in various intra-erythrocytic stages (rings, trophozoites and schizonts) in drug treated and untreated (control) mice showed that in the treated group ring stage parasite persists resulting in the fractional increase of rings as compared to trophozoite. Such a distribution can arise if the drug treatment blocks the transition from ring to trophozoite stage. Infected erythrocytes with the blocked ring stage parasites may eventually haemolyse, releasing the parasite in the host circulatory system. Immune response to such released parasites may result in robust antibody response that conferred immunity to subsequent parasite challenges. The ability of the geldanamycin to block stage transition in the parasite life cycle appears to be equivalent to immunization with an attenuated strain of a pathogen. Attenuated <italic>Plasmodium </italic>sporozoites prepared by irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] or genetic manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] are known to induce immunity. The sera collected from geldanamycin derivative-treated animals exhibited reactivity against most of the parasite proteins indicating a robust humoral response. Such sera have proved to be very useful reagent for the detection of unknown parasite proteins in analytical experiments.</p><p>For malaria vaccine development, efforts have been made to target liver, blood and/or sexual transmission stages using conventional vaccine approach of exposing the host to relevant antigens. A compilation of different antigen formulations and evaluations of field trials can be found at WHO site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Despite these efforts, there is currently no licensed, effective malaria vaccine. It is clear that for the purpose of malaria elimination, vaccines with much better efficacies are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. An emerging approach to counteract the immune-modulating effects of the parasite is to co-administer the antigens along with sub-optimal doses of immune-modulating anti-malarial drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The approach involves administration of virulent <italic>Plasmodium </italic>with sub therapeutic dose of an anti-malarial sufficient to contain the growth of the parasite to prevent symptoms while allowing induction of a protective immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Robust immunity observed here in GA treated mice against a lethal strain of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>suggests that this drug can be a potential candidate for co-administration with pathogen for the induction of immunity.</p><p>As mentioned above, clearance of parasite in geldanamycin treated mice showed sequential changes in infectivity from mature red blood cells to reticulocytes. This change in invasion specificity was also associated with loss of virulence and self-resolution of infection. Many host and parasite factors may influence such transitions between virulent and non-virulent states of the parasite. Genetic polymorphism involving a single amino acid substitution in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii </italic>erythrocyte binding-like protein (<italic>Pyebl</italic>) has been reported to be one such factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Similar changes in invasion specificity for <italic>P. yoelii </italic>(from mature rbcs to reticulocytes) were observed in experiments where immune protection conferred by <italic>P. falciparum </italic>enolase was investigated (unpublished data). As strong host mounted immune responses occurred in HSP90 inhibitor treated animals, it could be directly associated with the cause of preferential invasion of reticulocytes. It is possible that the observed change in host cell invasion specificity in response to geldanamycin treatment may have arisen due to a point mutation as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Since this change in invasion specificity (from normocytes to reticulocytes) of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL occurred in all the drug treated mice, it is highly unlikely that it can be due to a mutation in <italic>Pyebl </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. As this change in specificity of invasion is associated with the slow growth as well as loss of virulence in the parasite, it is expected that the expressed proteomes of the normocyte invading and the reticulocyte invading parasites may have significant differences. It may be interesting to compare expressed proteomes from these two states (normocyte invading and reticulocyte invading) of <italic>P. yoelii </italic>17XL to identify the molecular players that participate in determining the host cell invasion specificity and virulence.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; GA: geldanamycin; 17-AAG: 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; 17-PEG-Alkyn-GA: 17-N-(3-(2-(-2(3-aminopropoxy)ethoxy)propyl)pent-4-ynamide-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; PRBC: parasite infected red blood cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RM: Performed all the experiments and analyzed the data.
