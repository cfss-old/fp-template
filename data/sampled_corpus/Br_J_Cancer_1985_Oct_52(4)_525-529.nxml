The patients in each group were drawn from two separate populations, but the mean age and weight of the groups were similar and there were no significant differences between the pretreatment serum levels of the hormones investigated. Serum oestrone and oestradiol levels were suppressed by both treatments, but there was a significantly greater suppression by AG + HC. This greater suppression is probably due to the observed increase in serum androstenedione (i.e. precursor) levels with AG alone, whilst with AG + HC these levels were found to be reduced. In terms of suppression of serum oestrogen levels it is of benefit to combine low dose AG with HC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00096-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="525" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00096-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="526" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00096-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="527" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00096-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="528" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00096-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="529" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
