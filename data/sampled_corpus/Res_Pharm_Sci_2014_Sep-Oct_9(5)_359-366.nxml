Boiss, is widely used as a food additive with some imputed health effects in folk medicine of western Iran. Unfortunately, despite the prevalent medicinal uses of the plant, there are no reports on the toxic effects of <italic>T. buphthalmoides</italic> aerial parts. The present study evaluated the potential toxicity of dried hydroethanolic extract of the species in wistar rats. Also, we investigated antioxidant activity and total phenolic content (TPC) of the extract. In the acute study, single doses of extract were administered orally, and the rats were then monitored for 14 days. In the subchronic toxicity study, the sample was administered to the rats for 45 days. In the antioxidant capacity assays dried extract showed moderate to weak antioxidant activities. Also, the sample showed relatively notable TPC. The results of acute study indicated that the LD<sub>50</sub> of <italic>T. buphthalmoides</italic> is higher than 2500 mg/kg. Biochemical analysis showed some significant changes including creatinine, glucose and triglyceride levels. Moreover, some significant abnormality of lung, kidney and liver organs was observed. Based on the results of this study, adverse effect level (AEL) of dried hydroethanolic extract of <italic>T. buphthalmoides</italic> considered to be less than 175 mg/kg/day for the male and female rats.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Tragopogon buphthalmoides</italic></kwd><kwd>Antioxidant capacity</kwd><kwd>Acute toxicity</kwd><kwd>Subchronic toxicity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Tragopogon buphthalmoides</italic> (DC.) Boiss. (Synonym: <italic>T. persicus</italic> Boiss), which is also named as &#x0201c;Sheng e Iran&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Sheng e cheshmgaavi&#x0201d;, belongs to the family Asteraceae, tribe Cichorieae (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is a perennial herb of 5-50 cm height, with linear-lanceolate leaves and yellow flowers that distributed in many countries such as Syria, Turkey and Iran (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The Genus <italic>Tragopogon</italic>, commonly known as &#x0201c;salsify&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;goat's beard&#x0201d;, represents 25 species in the flora of Iran (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Previous phytochemical investigations on <italic>T. porrifolius</italic>, <italic>T. orientalis</italic> and <italic>T. pretensis</italic> led to the identification of dihydro isocoumarins, stilbenoids, olean saponins, triterpene saponins, bibenzyls and flavonoids (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Some biological studies showed diaphoretic, antitussive, anti acetylcholine esterase and antioxidant properties for plants of this genus (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, studies on phytochemical and biological profile of <italic>T. buphthalmoides</italic> have not been carried out, in order to confirm its assumed beneficial properties in folk medicine of western Iran. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the safety profile of <italic>T. buphthalmoides</italic> via evaluation of acute and subchronic toxicity of hydroethanolic extract in male and female Wistar rats. Additionally, total phenolic content (TPC) and the antioxidant activity of the extract were investigated by different methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>&#x003b2;-Carotene and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich.

All rats were allowed an 8-day acclimation period before initiation of acute or subchronic dosing, randomly assigned to a control or treatment group, and fasted for 3 h before dosing. Study was conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as found in the US guidelines (NIH Publication no. 85&#x02013;23, revised in 1985).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Acute toxicity study</title><p>At the onset of dosing, the males and the females weighed 194 &#x000b1; 3 and 148 &#x000b1; 9 g respectively.

Observations were made and recorded systematically at 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after administration of the extract, and daily thereafter for a total of 14 days. Animals were observed for body weight, general behavioral changes, and mortality for a period of 14 days post treatment.

In general, the first toxicity test performed on a compound is acute toxicity, determined from the administration of a single exposure.</p><p>The main objective of acute toxicity testing is to provide an approximation of the intrinsic toxicity of the substances often expressed as median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It is indicated that substances which present LD<sub>50</sub> greater than 2000 mg/kg when administered orally can be categorized practically non-toxic (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, it can be suggested that <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> is devoid of acute oral toxicity.</p><p>Evaluation of oral toxicity through a repeated dose 45-day experiment has been applied in many herbal safety assessment studies (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In subchronic study analyzing of blood parameters showed that <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> does not interfere with the formation of erythrocytes and leukocytes nor does it cause microcytosis or macrocytosis in rats. Hence, there were no toxicologically significant alterations in the hematological parameters. Blood sugar and triglycerides were observed to increase with increasing dose in female and male rats. Abnormal rise in FBS and triglycerides indicated significant metabolic effects of this extract in long term administration (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Liver function was evaluated by means of serum proteins, SGOT and SGPT. These markers usually help to detect chronic liver disease (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the current study, an increase in SGPT of female rats treated with <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> (350 mg/kg) was observed. Also the histopathological observations showed vascular and sinusoidal congestion and also an increased glycogen storage in the liver. Hepatic glycogen storage is regarded as a normal metabolic function but excessively intracellular accumulation can be related to hepatotoxicity or disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Kidney function was assessed by means of serum urea, creatinine, potassium and sodium. Serum creatinine is present after the chemical creatine is broken down by the body in order to make energy (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The kidney is normally able to filter out large amount of creatinine. Hence, high blood creatinine is a reliable indicator of a negative impact on kidney function or impaired glomerular filtration (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In the current study there was a statistically significant difference in serum creatinine in treated animals. It must be noted that the relationship between creatinine and the actual GFR is hyperbolic, not linear. Hence initial elevation of serum concentrations of these substances indicates a large decrease in renal performance (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, the histo-pathological analysis of kidneys revealed some abnormalities in this organ. Therefore, these results indicated that <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> has negative impacts on the kidneys. Moreover, congestion of alveolar capillaries and alveolar wall thickness in lung of rats (700 mg/kg) indicated that <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> may have some effects on this organ. The histopathological evaluation of other organs did not explain changes that could establish the dose&#x02013;response-dependent relationship to treatment with the <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> hydroalcoholic extract. The difference between male and female body weight indicates that female is more sensitive than male to subchronic toxicity effect of <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> because gender is one of the factors that could influences the response (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The principle goals of the subchronic study are to establish a &#x0201c;no observed adverse effect level&#x0201d; NOAEL and to further identify or characterize the specific organ or organs that affected by test compound after repeated exposure (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>The NOAEL is defined as the highest exposure level at which there is not any statistically or biologically significant increase in the frequency or severity of adverse effects between exposed and control groups. Determination of NOAEL has numerous regulatory implications. For example it used to calculate reference dose (RfD) by environmental protection agency EPA (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). On the basis of current study it can be concluded that liver and kidneys are possible target organs of <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic>. Also it was indicated that NOAEL of the <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> is less than 175 mg/kg for male and female rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, a number of significant clinical and pathological changes were associated with the subchronic oral administration of <italic>T. buphtalmoides</italic> hydro-alcoholic extract to Wistar rats. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that the risk of oral toxicity to mammals is not insignificant. Additionally, in the antioxidant capacity assays dried extract showed moderate to weak antioxidant activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors appreciate the Research Council of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences for the financial supports.
