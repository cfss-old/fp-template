Recent growth has been particularly dramatic in the states of The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), and these and other developing economies are at particular risk. We aimed to systematically review the quality of control of type 2 diabetes in the GCC, and the nature and efficacy of interventions. We identified 27 published studies for review. Studies were identified by systematic database searches. Medline and Embase were searched separately (via Dialog and Ovid, respectively; 1950 to July 2010 (Medline), and 1947 to July 2010 (Embase)) on 15/07/2009. The search was updated on 08/07/2010. Terms such as diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Gulf States were used. Our search also included scanning reference lists, contacting experts and hand-searching key journals. Studies were judged against pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and where suitable for inclusion, data extraction/quality assessment was achieved using a specifically-designed tool. All studies wherein glycaemic-, blood pressure- and/or lipid- control were investigated (clinical and/or process outcomes) were eligible for inclusion. No limitations on publication type, publication status, study design or language of publication were imposed. We found the extent of control to be sub-optimal and relatively poor. Assessment of the efficacy of interventions was difficult due to lack of data, but suggestive that more widespread and controlled trial of secondary prevention strategies may have beneficial outcomes. We found no record of audited implementation of primary preventative strategies and anticipate that controlled trial of such strategies would also be useful.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>The Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus problem</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterised by insufficient insulin production and/or insulin resistance. Through its various complications and a widespread high prevalence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>, diabetes mellitus is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Insulin resistance with a relative or real insulin deficiency is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over the last 3&#x02013;4 decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically across the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Amos1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-King1">[3]</xref>. It currently accounts for over 90&#x00025; of all diabetes cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-World1">[4]</xref>. Various factors including population growth, ageing, continued urbanisation and lifestyle modifications encouraging sedentary lifestyles and obesity, will lead to further increases in prevalence. Diabetes is a major public health issue, carrying huge societal and economic, as well as personal, costs and risks. This has been acknowledged by the United Nations through Resolution 61/225 (2006), which issued a call for Member States to implement strategies to address the burden of diabetes in their societies.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Type 2 diabetes in the Gulf region</title><p>The states of The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) exhibit some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the world. Five of the International Diabetes Federation's &#x02018;top 10&#x02019; countries for diabetes prevalence in 2010 and in 2030 are projected to be in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>. The anticipated prevalences for diabetes 2010&#x02013;2030 in the Gulf countries are: United Arab Emirates (UAE) 18.7&#x02013;21.4&#x00025;, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) 16.8&#x02013;18.9&#x00025;, Bahrain 15.4&#x02013;17.3&#x00025;, Kuwait 14.6&#x02013;16.9&#x00025; and Oman 13.4&#x02013;14.9&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>. The recent and rapid socio-economic development of the GCC countries has been associated with this rising prevalence. The International Diabetes Federation suggests that even in the absence of further economic development (that is, based on changes in population demography alone), the number of people with diabetes in its Middle East-North Africa region will increase 94&#x00025; from 2010 to 2030. Only the Sub-Saharan African region is expected to see a greater increase in the number of cases of diabetes (98&#x00025;) during this period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Responding to the type 2 diabetes problem</title><p>Many countries have responded to the concerns about type 2 diabetes by producing and implementing national diabetes programmes (at the suggestion of the World Health Assembly, aided and monitored by the International Diabetes Federation). The International Diabetes Federation suggests Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain have all implemented national diabetes programmes (with no data available for the UAE and KSA, and no national diabetes programme in Qatar) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>. The UAE, however, published national guidelines in 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-UAE1">[5]</xref>. We have not been able to determine that the KSA has a national programme, but note that it produces by far the greatest research output on diabetes. For all countries, the extent and timings of programme implementation are unclear, and in many cases the content of the programmes also. Although the IDF suggests various dimensions that a national diabetes programme would ideally include, there are no particular suggested standards in any of these themes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-International1">[1]</xref>. Although this reflects the need for locally tailored programmes, it perhaps also reflects that there are no standardised desired clinical outcomes, even in relatively well-studied populations. Both the extent and efficacy of current diabetes management in the GCC region is thus unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Review aims</title><p>The aim of this review was to examine the current quality of management of type 2 diabetes in the member states of the GCC. Unchecked, the chronic hyperglycaemia of diabetes is associated with various adverse macro- and micro- vascular outcomes. Glycaemic-, blood pressure- and lipid- control were used as indicator outcomes as they are relatively well established correlates of adverse vascular sequelae; preliminary searches suggested these were relatively frequently considered outcomes; and they are widely incorporated into national guidelines e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-American1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Greenfield1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Calvert1">[8]</xref>. We aimed to, wherever possible, specify results according to age and gender, as evidence indicates that age/gender specified sub-populations with specific disease prevalences and characteristics or severity may exist, and thus that these populations may benefit from differential management strategies. Due to the heterogeneity of studies identified on preliminary searching, there was no anticipated meta-analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Ethical approval was not needed as this study was a systematic review, with no primary data collection.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Review questions</title><p>A systematic literature search was carried out to identify information relevant to the following review questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How good is current control of type 2 diabetes in the GCC region, based on glycaemic-, blood pressure- and lipid- control indicators?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Have implemented strategies (including public health/preventative strategies) improved management of type 2 diabetes in GCC countries?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Search</title><p>We developed a systematic review protocol (available from the authors on request) using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Centre1">[9]</xref>. The Medline and Embase databases (via Dialog and Ovid, respectively; 1950 to July 2010 (Medline), and 1947 to July 2010 (Embase)) were searched separately on 15/07/2009 and the search was updated on 08/07/2010. The search was carried out using terms identified from PICOS deconstruction of the above review questions, and database- and manually- derived alternatives (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022186.s007">Appendix S1</xref>). Keywords used in the search strategies reflected the quality of management of type 2 diabetes and blood pressure, lipids and glucose in the GCC such as diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Gulf States. The search strategy (available from the authors on request) was trialled, reviewed by independent professional colleagues (E.H, K.P), and updated (on 02/02/2010) before use. Further relevant studies were identified by searching the reference lists of the database-derived papers, contacting expert investigators, screening conference proceedings including those of The International Conference on Recent Advances in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications 2006 and Gulf Research Meeting 2010, citation searching and hand searching the available online contents of the International Journal of Diabetes and Metabolism and the Saudi Medical Journal, between the periods 1993&#x02013;2009 and 2000&#x02013;2010, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Selection</title><p>The search yielded 788 studies. The titles and abstracts were evaluated by one reviewer to determine eligibility for full screening.

All studies wherein glycaemic-, blood pressure- and/or lipid- control were investigated (clinical and/or process outcomes) were eligible for inclusion. In addition, any study describing primary preventative measures was eligible. No limitations on publication type, publication status, study design or language of publication were imposed. However, we did not include secondary reports such as review articles without novel synthesis. The inclusion criteria demanded that the study population be people with diabetes (at least predominantly type 2; unless a study relating to primary prevention), and of a GCC country. All ages, sexes and ethnicities were included, resident and expatriate populations, urban and rural, of all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. General population studies and studies at all healthcare levels were included. 33 studies were identified as suitable for full review, and were each considered by 2 reviewers. 6 studies were excluded, by consensus, either because data were not (fully) available, or because the reporting left us unable to assess, sufficiently, study quality (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022186-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022186.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0022186-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0022186.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart study selection process.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0022186.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data extraction/quality assessment</title><p>The data captured for each study included data relating to, (1) methods (study design, recruitment, measurement tools, analysis), (2) participant characteristics, (3) setting, and (4) outcomes (those observed, their definitions, results of analysis, length of follow-up).

Almost universally, fewer than 50&#x00025; of patients meet targets for these clinical outcomes. There were no clear differences between primary and secondary or tertiary care (although possibly blood pressure was better controlled in hospital settings).</p><p>The reviewed intervention studies were largely uncontrolled, and thus difficult to interpret. All strategies reviewed here did appear to improve outcomes, but involved multiple interventions and are likely to have been carried out against a background of evolving healthcare. No intervention studied included a primary preventative dimension.</p><p>Although we rate the quality of type 2 diabetes management in the GCC region as &#x02018;poor&#x02019;, the outcomes are similar to those reported from elsewhere. Due to the disparity in genetic and environmental contexts, type of health system, differences in intervention methods and management guidelines and target thresholds, we do not intend to suggest that any particular intervention method is similarly efficacious across regions. Nevertheless, we noted that for both clinical- and process- outcomes, similar results are reported for other countries in the region such Lebanon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Akel1">[37]</xref> and Egypt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Youssef1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-ElShazly1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-AbouElEnein1">[40]</xref>.

Notably, of the non-GCC region studies mentioned, this study includes perhaps the highest proportions of patients under relatively high level care. Although it may therefore underestimate outcomes more generally achieved, it may in fact be a better comparator for the mixed populations included in our review. We note also that in many cases the outcomes of our reviewed studies would satisfy the upper thresholds of the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Calvert1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>With regard to process measures, these were generally well met in all settings, but probably more so in the non-GCC developed regions, particularly for glycaemic control. Finally, and importantly, we note that with regard to intermediate outcomes of diabetes control, there has been evident progress in at least the UK and USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Calvert1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Khunti1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-Saaddine1">[43]</xref>, which we have not observed here to be the case in the GCC region.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations of study</title><p>A major limitation on the strength of our conclusions lies in the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies. They were of varied populations, reported on variable outcome measures, were from various levels of healthcare provision and different countries (although were predominantly from some and notably did not include all GCC countries). Our outcomes of review are therefore necessarily of only a broad nature, and as expected, they were not appropriate for use in synthesis of outcomes with estimates of confidence.</p><p>All of our reviewed studies were published in English. Overall, the clarity of reporting in the reviewed papers was considered relatively low; considered so as it often hampered assessment of study quality. In a few cases, we excluded studies due to an inability to sufficiently assess study quality (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022186-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Otherwise, we did not exclude studies based on quality, but noted some major limitations, particularly in the intervention studies. With regard to the cross-sectional studies, the relatively low numbers of papers returned by each search led to difficultly identifying inconsistencies versus widening accepted value ranges and extent of possible effects, and in turn difficulty considering the strength of our final proposals. Nevertheless, we feel the data are sufficient that we might comment on their potential implications for type 2 diabetes care in the GCC region.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Implications</title><p>We believe &#x02013; based on the mentioned studies from non-GCC countries and the intervention studies reviewed here &#x02013; that the standards of diabetes care in the GCC region can be improved. Both of these sets of studies suggest that improved adherence to process measures would improve clinical outcomes. In defining these desired process outcomes, and the mechanisms to comply, it may be useful to consider some of the interventions implemented in the reviewed intervention studies. These could potentially be as effective as those implemented elsewhere, and there is a degree of overlap. For example, the use of patient education programmes, diabetes specialist nurses and self-glucose monitoring appear to be potentially useful and are relatively well developed components of systems elsewhere. Continued auditing of these and other interventions will be important. Standardising both the process and clinical measures for clinical use and for auditing would be useful to facilitate comparisons, although this has yet to be achieved elsewhere, and fixing standards may be difficult. A review of potentially useful and realistic standards for this region has not been achieved and would be helpful.</p><p>We also consider that there is a large role for primary prevention programmes in any new management strategy. It is unclear whether or not any such intervention has been trialled in this region, and a concerted/wide-reaching programme is probably essential for feasibility and success of diabetes management. Finally, we have not considered strategies likely to produce changes in diabetes management without being aimed <italic>specifically</italic> towards this (e.g. those implemented as part of the World Health Organization &#x02018;Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework&#x02019; adaptations in health systems associated with the shift towards management of chronic rather than acute diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022186-World2">[46]</xref>), but it is anticipated that such changes will also be an important part of managing the diabetes burden in the GCC region.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically review the quality of diabetes care in the GCC region. We found management of type 2 diabetes, as indicated by three major intermediate outcome measures (glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipid profile), to be sub-optimal in the GCC countries. In addition, we found that in many of the reviewed studies, there were quality issues that impacted on their usefulness. We thus feel attention to the management of diabetes in this region needs to be improved, and that enhanced management must include better quality of research and production of valuable data.</p><p>With regard to specific management strategies, we have here reviewed several studies of interventions, which suggest a number of secondary prevention strategies that may help in raising the quality of management in this region. However, other forms of intervention &#x02013; particularly primary prevention strategies, which have not been clearly implemented or audited &#x02013; are also likely to be useful. We anticipate that co-ordinated implementation of locally-successful/targeted strategies may be particularly effective. Continued, high quality review of all forms of interventions in the GCC states would also be desirable.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>PRISMA 2009 checklist.</bold></p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>PRISMA 2009 flow diagram.</bold></p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of glycaemic control.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s003.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s004"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of BP control.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s004.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s005"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of lipid control.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s005.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s006"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of intervention studies.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s006.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s007"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p><bold>Research questions for quality of type 2 diabetes management in the GCC countries using PICO.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s007.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022186.s008"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p><bold>Study quality assessment.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022186.s008.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Igor Wei who helped with the electronic search strategy.
