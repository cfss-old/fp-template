Chemosensory receptor proteins, including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) function to interface the insect with its chemical environment. Codling moth, <italic>Cydia pomonella</italic>, is a worldwide pest of apple, pear and walnut, and behavior-modifying semiochemicals are used for environmentally safe control. We produced an Illumina-based transcriptome from antennae of males and females as well as neonate head tissue, affording a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the codling moth chemosensory receptor repertoire. We identified 58 ORs, 20 GRs and 21 IRs, and provide a revised nomenclature that is consistent with homologous sequences in related species. Importantly, we have identified several OR transcripts displaying sex-biased expression in adults, as well as larval-enriched transcripts. Our analyses have expanded annotations of the chemosensory receptor gene families, and provide first-time transcript abundance estimates for codling moth. The results presented here provide a strong foundation for future work on codling moth behavioral physiology and ecology at the molecular level, and may lead to the development of more precise biorational control strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The codling moth, <italic>Cydia pomonella</italic> L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae), is an economically significant and worldwide pest of apple, pear and walnut. Air permeation with synthetic sex pheromone is used to disrupt pre-mating olfactory communication for areawide codling moth control. This demonstrates the potential of behavioral manipulation with semiochemicals, but current methods are not yet sufficient to contain high population densities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Codling moth is also a model species for investigations of the role of plant odorants in sexual communication and host finding in insect herbivores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. A greater understanding of olfactory and other facets of chemosensory communication, leading to the discovery of key signals mediating reproductive and host-seeking behaviours, holds promise for implementation of sustainable insect control and for the study of plant-herbivore interactions. Additionally, consideration of chemosensory-based control of larvae has merit, as it is the larvae that damage the host fruit; however, the molecular determinants that govern larval chemosensory behaviors remain to be characterized.</p><p>The chemosensory system, through olfactory pathways, is involved in food, mate and host seeking behaviors, as well as predator and parasitoid avoidance; feeding and egg-laying, on the other hand, are influenced primarily through gustatory pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Odorant perception largely occurs in the primary olfactory appendages, the antennae and maxillary palps, which are covered with porous hairs (sensilla). Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) project their dendrites into the olfactory sensilla, and odorant receptor (OR) proteins are located in the dendritic cell membrane of OSNs and serve as the molecular interface between the insect and its odor environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Similarly, the sense of taste is mediated by gustatory receptors (GRs) in the dendritic membranes of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), which project into sensilla on appendages with gustatory function, including proboscis, tarsi and ovipositor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In both cases, binding of chemical stimuli from the environment activates receptor proteins, and ultimately leads to receptor-mediated neuron depolarization and transmission of the chemical sensory message to the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Insect ORs were first discovered through data-mining of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>r genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and subsequently it was determined that ORs display a high degree of divergence, both within and across species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. A large family of insect GRs were discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> soon after the annotation of the ORs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and it was demonstrated that both ORs and GRs comprise an evolutionarily related superfamily of insect chemoreceptor proteins (CRs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Finally, a second family of olfactory receptors, known as ionotropic receptors (IRs), was identified, also initially in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>In Lepidoptera, the study of CR families became possible when the genome of the silk moth, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> was sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The advent of transcriptomic analyses further facilitated large-scale discovery and characterization of chemosensory gene transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. A PCR-based technique was successfully used to identify putative pheromone receptor (PR) fragments from various Lepidoptera, including five from codling moth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Subsequently, a transcriptomics-based approach identified a larger family of antennal-expressed ORs, GRs, and IRs in codling moth antennae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, including ORs belonging to the lepidopteran OR clade of putative PRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent reports have identified larger sets of ORs in three tortricid moths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and a full set of 68 GRs have been identified in <italic>B. mori</italic>, including broadly conserved carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and sugar receptors that have not yet been found in <italic>C. pomonella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Moreover, many previously reported codling moth OR sequences did not contain complete open reading frames (ORFs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>In this current study, we used Illumina-based RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) methodology to provide deeper transcriptome coverage of <italic>C. pomonella</italic> antennae and larval heads. Our goal was to provide a more comprehensive identification of adult expressed CRs, identify ORs expressed in larvae, and provide initial abundance estimates of CR gene expression. Here we describe 21 novel ORs, 19 GRs and 6 IRs, and additionally provide complete ORF sequence information for 20 previously identified ORs. Furthermore, we report several ORs displaying sexually biased expression in adult moths and identify larval CR transcripts for the first time in this species.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptome assembly and overview</title><p>A <italic>de novo C. pomonella</italic> transcriptome was generated by an Illumina HiSeq 90PE approach. A total of 159,222,221 filtered sequencing read pairs plus 6,471,828 unpaired reads from male antenna, female antenna and neonate larval head RNA libraries were assembled with the Trinity assembler into 152,890 contigs (&#x0003e;201&#x02009;nt). After removing redundant sequences, our transcriptome contained 108,218 contig clusters (Trinity gene level) and 145,710 total sequences, with a mean length of 675.44&#x02009;nt, an N50 length of 1019&#x02009;nt, and 26,135 sequences greater than 1,000&#x02009;nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S1</xref>).</p><p>To assess the quality of the transcriptome, we ran a blast query against it with the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> core eukaryotic genes dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. A total of 454 out of 457 conserved core gene homologues were present (blast e-value less than 7e-06, similarity greater than 47.72%). The nature of the 50 most abundant gene clusters was quantitatively examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S2</xref>) to provide a tissue-specific qualitative characterization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In the male antenna, 27 of the top 50 most abundant gene clusters were homologous to genes with putative chemosensory function (16 odorant binding proteins (OBP), 10 chemosensory proteins (CSP), and one sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP), with an expression share of 41.7% of the summed fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads (FPKM) value. In female antennae, 30 of the top 50 most abundant gene clusters were homologous to putative chemosensory proteins (20 OBP, 10 CSP), with a 27.3% share of the summed FPKM values. In larval heads, no genes with putative chemosensory function were observed in the 50 most abundant clusters; 39 of the top 50 gene clusters were homologous to either ribosomal proteins (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), muscle-related proteins (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) or mitochondrial related proteins (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11), for a collective 63.0% share of the summed FPKM values. The observation of enrichment of OBP and CSP expression in the male and female antennal tissues is consistent with a recent previous report utilizing similar methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Odorant Receptors</title><p>Through qualitative transcriptome analysis, 58 putative ORs were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S4</xref>), of which 47 were determined to contain full-length ORFs, based upon the presence of predicted start and stop codons and 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTR).</p><p>Further assembly of our transcriptome, combining incomplete transcripts with published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, yielded 53 full-length OR sequences, including complete ORFs for 20 of 21 previously incomplete OR transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and 21 novel ORs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Six previously annotated ORs comprise 3 unique gene models, where N and C terminal encoding sequence fragments were reported as unique transcripts (previously OR7/OR41, OR27/OR29 and OR36/39). Additionally, through blast homology analysis, the previously annotated OR43 and OR44 fragments have been determined to represent 3&#x02032; UTR sequence and do not encode OR proteins.</p><p>Based on our findings and recent transcriptome reports of OR repertoires in other tortricids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we present a revised nomenclature of <italic>C. pomonella</italic> ORs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Our annotations did not include an additional 13 partial transcript cluster sequences that contained protein-coding sequence fragments homologous to ORs and may represent novel, functional gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S6</xref>). The top insect OR blast hits for the translated protein sequences for each of these fragments had e-value scores less than or equal to 7e-08. The <italic>C. pomonella</italic> ORs are presented phylogenetically within the context of other tortricid moth species from which large OR repertoires have been published, along with <italic>B. mori</italic> ORs serving as a lepidopteran outgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>For most ORs, only one unique ORF was identified. However, two protein encoding transcripts for OR6 were identical, except for their C-terminal ends (variant sequence after amino acid residue 398T). These putative variant transcripts have been confirmed through molecular cloning and sequencing, and are annotated as OR6a/OR6b. To provide a greater degree of confidence in the transcriptomic sequences, we cloned and sequenced complete ORFs of several other ORs, namely, CpomOR2a/b/c (see below), CpomOR5, CpomOR30, CpomOR39, CpomOR41 and CpomOR71. For each of these receptors, all full length ORF nucleotide sequences identified in our primary transcriptome displayed between 98.52 and 99.52% identity to a sequenced clone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S7</xref>). Comparison of the 16 ORs that contained complete ORFs in both this transcriptome and the previously reported assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> revealed that nucleotide sequences were at least 98.2% identical within the protein coding region.</p><p>The OR2 locus was present as a complex cluster of sequences. Four variant transcripts encoded similar N-terminal fragments. Three additional transcripts encoded C terminal fragments; these transcripts contained identical C-terminal ORFs that overlapped with the N-terminal fragments, but were variant in their 3&#x02032; UTRs. The C-terminal ends of these fragments were nearly identical in amino acid sequence to three receptors (named CpOR1a, CpOR11 and CpOR11a) previously identified by 3&#x02032; RACE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We obtained full-length ORFs by 5&#x02032; RACE using primers designed in the 3&#x02032; UTR, each of which contained unique nucleic acid sequence. These receptors have been annotated as CpomOR2a, CpomOR2b and CpomOR2c. Analysis of the full-length amino acid sequences encoded by the transcripts for CpomOR2a/2b/2c indicate three unique, but highly similar transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Comparison of the nucleic acid sequences show that CpomOR2a is 92% identical to OR2b and 89% identical to OR2c, while OR2b is 89% identical to OR2c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). The deduced proteins for the CpomOR2 group were also highly similar, with OR2a being 88% identical and 91% similar to OR2b, OR2a is 84% identical and 89% similar to OR2c, and OR2b is 84% identical and 90% similar to OR2c. Analysis of seven individual clones obtained from CpomOR2a revealed that there might be two forms of this receptor. Comparison of the OR2a clones revealed 18 distinct single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) resulting in 6 amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S10 and S11</xref>), with OR2a1 and OR2a2 being 98% identical on the nucleic acid level and sharing 96% identity and 98% similarity on the amino acid level.</p><p>For quantitative analysis of OR expression levels, we compared FPKM values for transcript clusters. For male antennae, estimated OR transcript expression levels ranged from 0.03 to 1129.88 FPKM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S12</xref>). OR1 (1129.88 FPKM), OR6 (83.68 FPKM) and OR3 (67.28 FPKM) were the most abundantly expressed tuning ORs in the male antennae, and all three of these receptors cluster phylogenetically within the lepidopteran pheromone receptor subfamily clade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For female antennae, FPKM values of ORs ranged from 0.22 to 785.91. OR3 (105.54 FPKM), OR13 (96.59 FPKM) and OR40 (78.65 FPKM) were the most abundantly expressed tuning ORs. In the larval head, FPKM values for ORs ranged from 0 to 4.8. OR64 (4.67 FPKM), OR18 (4.39 FPKM) and OR71 (3.9 FPKM) were the most abundantly expressed in neonate heads. In all three tissue samples, the OR co-receptor, Orco<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> displayed higher expression levels compared to most tuning ORs (male antennae, FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;987.83; female antennae, FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;785.91; larval heads, FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.8).</p><p>Comparison of transcript abundance levels between male and female antennae revealed several receptors with sex-enriched or biased expression patterns (FPKM&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10-fold difference between sexes; FPKM&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 in non-enriched sex). OR1, OR5, OR6, OR7, and OR31 were male-enriched, while OR21, OR22, OR30 and OR41 showed female-enriched expression. Sex-biased enrichment of ORs in male or female antennae was examined qualitatively through end-point PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). Consistent with transcriptome FPKM values, male sex-biased amplification was observed for OR5, OR6 and OR31, and female sex-biased amplification for OR21, OR22, OR30 and OR41. We were unable to consistently amplify OR7 in either tissue, and amplification of OR1 was observed in both male and female antennal tissues, which is also consistent with FPKM values.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gustatory Receptors</title><p>The primary transcriptome contained 20 GRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S14</xref>), including 19 novel gene models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Seven GR transcripts contained complete ORFs based upon the predicted presence of start and stop codons and 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs. The conserved C-terminal motif, &#x0201c;TYhhhhhQF&#x0201d; (h&#x02009;=&#x02009;hydrophobic amino acid R group), characteristic of GRs, was identified in 13 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). CpomGR1 was identified as an incomplete fragment, but the full-length ORF was obtained by RACE to verify sequence. As the most complete moth GR repertoire was first reported for <italic>B. mori</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we adapted <italic>C. pomonella</italic> GR nomenclature to the nearest neighbor <italic>B. mori</italic> homologues where strong bootstrap support was available, including a revision of the previously annotated CpomGR4 to CpomGR8.

Complete ORFs, based on predicted start and stop codons, and 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs, were identified for 15 of the 21 CpomIRs, including 8 of the 12 previously reported incomplete IR gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S17</xref>).</p><p>We compared our predicted IR protein products with IRs and iGluRs identified from <italic>B. mori</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, as well as 8 novel CpomiGluRs. Determination of IR status has largely been inferred by phylogenetic analysis of IRs versus ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which cluster separately from the IRs. Based on phylogenetic relationships between IRs across these three species, IRs previously annotated as CpomIR41a, CpomIR75, CpomIR75p and CpomIR75q2 have been re-annotated as CpomIR41a.1, CpomIR75q.1, CpomIR75p.2 and CpomIR75q.2, respectively.</p><p>For an initial estimate of IR abundance levels, FPKM values were compared. For all tissues, three putative IR co-receptors, IR8a, IR25a and IR76b<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> were the most abundantly expressed. FPKM values in male antennae, female antennae and larval heads, respectively, were 255.83, 278.75 and 1.18 for IR8a; 291.98, 243.76 and 14.17 for IR25a; and 383.43, 390.48 and 7.74 for IR76b.

Since the codling moth genome is not yet sequenced, it is unclear if the CpomOR2 transcripts are products of several unique, but highly related genes, or if they result from alternative splicing of a single gene.</p><p>A total of 11 ORs were identified that cluster within the lepidopteran pheromone receptor subfamily clade; all of these receptors contained the conserved PWE motif typically found in receptors within this clade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Six of these eleven receptors display sex-biased/enriched expression. It has recently been demonstrated that RNA-Seq read mapping data showing sex-biased expression of moth ORs are reliable when compared to quantitative real-time PCR expression assays for the same transcripts in the same tissue types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Here, we support these findings, demonstrating a general consistency of results for sex-biased receptors using both read-mapping and standard end-point PCR assays.</p><p>In male antennae, CpomOR1 was, by far, the most highly expressed tuning OR, and we predict that this receptor may be tuned to the main sex pheromone component, (<italic>E,E</italic>)-8,10-dodecadienol (codlemone). This is in line with the finding that the most abundant OSN type in male <italic>C. pomonella</italic> antennae is responsive to codlemone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>As previously reported, CpomOR22 (formerly OR15) displayed female-specific expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

Interestingly, a <italic>B. mori</italic> orthologue to CpomOR22, BmorOR6, has been reported as a male biased OR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. While these ORs cluster, phylogenetically, with the PR subfamily clade, no ligands have been reported for any of them.</p><p>Strikingly, CpomOR3, though clustering within the PR clade, has been observed to respond to the host plant volatile, pear ester<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. CpomOR3 is the most and third most highly expressed tuning OR in female and male antennae, respectively. This is consistent with the finding that CpomOR3 is tuned to pear ester, which is a strong bisexual host plant attractant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; the common evolutionary lineage of CpomOR3 with putative PRs is impressively corroborated by coding of pear ester in the macroglomerular complex of the male antennal lobe, which responds to sex pheromones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>Beyond the PR clade, a second subfamily clade contained CpomORs displaying sex-biased expression patterns; CpomOR30 and CpomOR41 display female-biased expression, while CpomOR31 displays male-biased expression. This pattern is consistent with sex-biased expression of ORs within this clade from other species: BmorOR30, displays female-biased expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, while the tortricid EposOR30/OR34, CoblOR30 and CherOR30 display male-biased expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Although attempts to characterize the odorant response profiles of some of these receptors have not been successful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the sex-biased expression suggests possible involvement in sexual communication.</p><p>We provide a significant update of the GRs expressed in <italic>C. pomonella</italic> antennae, with the annotation of 20 GRs. Based upon phylogeny, this includes conserved putative CO<sub>2</sub> receptors (CpomGR1/GR2/GR3), sugar receptors (CpomGR4/GR5), including the fructose receptor subfamily clade (CpomGR8/GR9/GR10), and more divergent putative bitter compound receptors (CpomGR29/GR30/GR55/GR58/GR60/GR61/GR63/GR68.1-GR68.5)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. CpomGR8 and CpomGR9 are the two most abundantly expressed GRs in both the male and female antennae of <italic>C. pomonella</italic>, and are members of the GR subfamily clade that contains receptors shown to be responsive to D-fructose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The presence of abundantly expressed putative fructose receptors in codling moth antennae is consistent with moth antennal sensitivity to D-fructose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p><italic>Cydia pomonella</italic> GRs expressed in adult antennal and larval head tissues likely represent only a fraction of the complete GR repertoire. In the silkmoth, <italic>B. mori</italic>, 68 GRs have been identified in the sequenced genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, while the genomes of the butterflies <italic>D. plexippus</italic> and <italic>H. melpomene</italic>, encode 57 and 73 GRs, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. As gustatory sensory neurons are primarily found in chemosensory sensilla on leg tarsi and ovipositors, it is predicted that examination of transcript expression in these tissues will lead to the identification of a greater number of GR transcripts.</p><p>Compared to ORs, taxa-specific expansions of a GR lineage appear to be more common<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Our observations are consistent with this. Five GR68 paralogues were identified in <italic>C. pomonella</italic>, whereas only one gene from this cluster was identified in the genomes of <italic>B. mori, D. plexipus</italic> and <italic>H. melpomene</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Diversification of GR gene repertoire is thought to be essential for host-plant compatibility, especially as it relates to selection of suitable plants for oviposition and larval feeding. Consistent with this, GR68 clusters within the broad family of putative bitter compound GRs that speculatively play a significant role in the detection of host-plant substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Recent work on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> GRs, describes the molecular and cellular mechanisms of bitter taste reception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. However, putative bitter GRs have not been functionally characterized in moths.</p><p>We identified 21 antennal IR gene transcripts, which is similar to observations in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. As with the relatively high antennal expression of the OR co-receptor, Orco, the most highly expressed IR transcripts in both the male and female antennae were the putative IR co-receptors, IR8a, IR25s and IR76b. While antennal-expressed IRs from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been functionally characterized and shown to respond to odorant stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, moth IRs have not been investigated. However, since IRs display phylogenetic homology across insect orders, it is predicted that <italic>C. pomonella</italic> IRs mediate olfactory reception of acids and amines in the antennae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>For all three CR families, subsets of gene transcripts were found to be expressed in the larval head, which was used as proxy for expression in larval olfactory tissues in the antennae and maxillary palps. In adult male and female antennae, all 58 CpomORs had FPKM values greater than zero, while for our larval head sample only 38 ORs displayed non-zero FPKM values. Similarly, in the larval head, positive FPKM values were detected for 16 of 20 GRs and 15 of 21 IRs. In order to provide more thorough verification of CR expression in neonate larvae, we screened a secondary <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome generated from only the larval head sequenced reads for the presence of CR transcripts; identification of assembled CR sequences is presumed to be indicative of biologically meaningful expression levels. In this larval head transcriptome, sequences of 16 ORs, 8 GRs, and 9 IRs were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S12, S16 and S18</xref>).</p><p>In our primary transcriptome, the pear ester receptor, CpomOR3, was not detected in the neonate larval head (FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0). However, FPKM values near the threshold of detection are not reliable, and a fragment identical to this OR in the secondary larval head transcriptome suggests its expression. This finding has been confirmed by independent end-point PCR analysis of expression in <italic>C. pomonella</italic> neonate larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S19</xref>), and is consistent with a report showing that <italic>C. pomonella</italic> larvae are responsive to pear ester<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>CpomOR71 was one of the most highly expressed ORs in the neonate larval head. Larval enriched ORs may be responsive to host plant cues that signal qualitative suitability or unsuitability of the larval host for initiation and continuation of feeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Interestingly, CpomOR71 is a putative homologue to the <italic>S. litura</italic> receptor, SlituOR12, (49% identity/67% similarity), which is responsive to (<italic>Z</italic>)3-hexenyl acetate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This compound is an abundant compound in apple volatile headspace and may be an important cue for larval host-fruit seeking behavior of codling moth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>We provide here a more complete account of the <italic>C. pomonella</italic> CR repertoire. This is a solid foundation for future research on chemical signals mediating codling moth behavior, as well as a better understanding of its chemosensory system. This know-how will further augment the efficacy of control based on behavior-modifying odorants, and thus help to reduce the use of environmentally harmful chemicals in fruit orchards. As an example, we identified pear ester as the ligand for CpomOR3, which is a pheromone receptor subfamily clade OR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Pear ester is indeed a powerful, bisexual adult and larval attractant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It will be exciting and rewarding to study other highly expressed CRs, especially those showing distinct sexual bias. Ligands for these receptors are good candidates for further development of sustainable codling moth control.</p><p>The highly selective and sensitive response of CpomOR3 to the plant compound pear ester compares to the response of PRs to sex pheromone ligands. In combination with behavioral and physiological studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, it highlights the dual role of plant signals in habitat selection and in premating sexual communication, as well as their interaction with social signals during the phylogenetic divergence of insect herbivores. Moreover, CpomOR3 is rather exclusively tuned to pear ester, which is behaviorally active on its own, and which is specific for apple and pear, the main host plants of codling moth. This challenges the view that moths employ blends of ubiquitous plant volatiles, in host specific ratios, for host finding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. A dedicated receptor enables codling moth to pick up even small amounts of the host-specific pear ester signal, at a resolution that compares to perception of pheromone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. This finding illustrates that the codling moth chemosensory transcriptome is a rich substrate and provides inspiration for studying the chemical ecology of host finding in codling moth and other insect herbivores.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Samples of first instar larval heads, adult male antennae, and adult female antennae were prepared for RNA sequencing (see Insect Rearing and RNA Extraction; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Materials and Methods</xref>) at the National Genomics Infrastructure sequencing facility (Uppsala, Sweden).
