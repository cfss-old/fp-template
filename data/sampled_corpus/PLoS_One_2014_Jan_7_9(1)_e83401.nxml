Differently from UVB, UVA rays are able to penetrate further into the dermal layers of skin where they are absorbed by skin chromophores triggering the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the resident dermal fibroblasts and in extra-cellular structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Wondrak1">[2]</xref>. This contributes to oxidative damage, alterations in gene expression, DNA damage, ultimately leading to cell inflammation, photoageing and photocarcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Bickers1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Vile1">[5]</xref>. It is no surprise then, that in recent times, the necessity to combine UVA protection to the already known UVB protection of sunscreens has become of major importance, leading to the development of sunscreens containing broadband UVB/A filters.</p><p>UV filters are the active ingredients of sunscreens able to absorb/reflect/dissipate UV radiation thus reducing the amount of UV light reaching the viable skin layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Palm1">[6]</xref>, and two important requisites which determine their efficacy are their spectral profile and their photostability. Their absorbance spectra should remain unaltered throughout the whole exposure period guaranteeing uniform and sufficient UVA/B coverage, which implies that they should be photochemically stable. They should not breakdown after UV absorption since this would lead to a loss in absorbance and consequently to reduced photoprotection of the sunscreens containing them. In addition, any photoproducts released following degradation, that may also comprise ROS, could be toxic, irritant and cause allergic reactions responsible for skin alterations. Most UV filters are sufficiently photochemically stable, however some commonly used ones are not. For example, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), the most widely used UVA filter in sunscreens worldwide and nowadays also in daily face creams, is inherently photounstable, breaking down to form free radicals following UVA exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-LhiaubetVallet1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Schwack1">[9]</xref>. For this reason, it is common practice, albeit not always, to co-formulate it with photostabilizers such as octocrylene, methylbenzylidene camphor or bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, to reduce its photoinstability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Bonda1">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Following our on-going studies on the photostability assessment of sunscreens and UV filters and on our pursuit of new UV filters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-CrovaraPescia1">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Venditti1">[19]</xref>, we recently came across a class of compounds, namely benzoxazine nitrones, that absorb in the UVB and partly in the UVA region. However, nitrones are notoriously known to be photosensitive and under UV irradiation they photo-rearrange and decompose with consequent decrease in UV absorbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Alberti1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Battistoni1">[21]</xref>. Therefore a set of compounds with similar structure, but without the nitrone group responsible for the photoinstability observed, and with different substituents typically found in UV filters, were synthesized. Their photostability was first assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> in liposomes, and the most promising compound was then formulated in a cream and its efficacy was tested and compared to BMDBM. For this latter purpose, a cell culture system consisting of human dermal fibroblasts was employed and exposed to UVA light in the presence or absence of the formulations, which were spread on quartz petri-dishes placed above the cells but not in direct contact with them. In fact, a good UVA filter should not penetrate the epidermal layer and should screen out UVA rays as much as possible, in order to protect the underlying dermal fibroblasts from UVA damage. Several end-points which directly reflect UVA-induced oxidative damage were determined, such as intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial function, DNA integrity. The mRNA expression levels of two important genes linked to photoageing were also investigated: MMP-1, the major enzyme responsible for collagen degradation in the dermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Matrisian1">[22]</xref>, and COL1A1, the gene encoding for synthesis of &#x003b1;1(I)-procollagen, a component of type-I collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Karsenty1">[23]</xref>. Using the simple <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental method proposed, the efficacy of UV filters and sunscreens at the cellular and molecular level, under conditions which closely mimic their actual application and exposure, can be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Carboxy-2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-DCFH-DA), 5,5&#x02032;,6,6&#x02032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x02032;,3,3&#x02032; tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), and propidium iodide were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen).

To this end, aside from wearing protective clothing, hats, glasses, and being sensible about sun exposure, the most popular method is through the use of topical sunscreens that contain UV filters as their active ingredients. Evaluation of the efficacy of sunscreens <italic>in vivo</italic> is based on their Sun Protection Factor (SPF) which is a measure of protection against sunburn or erythema, a biological response primarily due to UVA2 (320&#x02013;340 nm) and UVB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-COLIPA1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Sayre1">[41]</xref>. Instead, <italic>in vivo</italic> UVA protection is based on the immediate (seconds) or persistent (2&#x02013;24 h) pigmentation changes or on the minimal erythematous response and persistent pigmentation of the skin caused by UVA (IPD, PPD, UVA-PF methods, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Seite1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Routaboul1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Wendel1">[43]</xref>. However, besides from being costly and time consuming, these <italic>in vivo</italic> methods raise ethical issues because of the potential damage to the skin of volunteers. Also, these parameters only reflect part of the UV-induced cascade of reactions in the skin. They give us no information about what actually happens at the cellular and molecular level of viable skin cells reached by UV rays that sunscreens do not manage to filter out. Furthermore, the SPF method has become under close scrutiny because of the anti-inflammatory effect of several UV filters present in current sunscreen products that can suppress erythema and hence yield a false impression of the amount of UV protection actually provided by the sunscreens containing them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Couteau1">[44]</xref>. For the above motivations, <italic>in vitro</italic> testing is strongly recommended, as also exemplified by the recent ban on animal testing in Europe for cosmetic products and ingredients due to ethical reasons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-European1">[45]</xref>. To this end, several <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques have already been developed, however at present there is no broadly accepted method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Pelizzo1">[46]</xref>.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that by using simple, <italic>in vitro</italic> tests such as those proposed here, the efficacy of UV filters and sunscreens at the cellular and molecular level, under conditions which mimic their actual application and exposure, can be investigated. In fact, to be efficient, a sunscreen should screen out as much as possible the UV rays reaching the skin, the majority of which are UVA (&#x0003e;95%). UVA rays are capable of penetrating into the dermis where fibroblasts reside and to induce cell damage via generation of ROS, through the photoexcitation of endogenous photosensitizers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Wondrak1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-ScharffetterKochanek1">[4]</xref>. UVA-induced oxidative damage mediated by increased ROS formation has consequences both at the molecular and cellular level. Cell viability can be compromised, mitochondrial function can be impaired, genotoxicity may arise through the formation of double- and single-strand breaks and oxidized purines, and the expression of important genes involved in the extracellular matrix of skin may be modulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Bickers1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Polte1">[47]</xref>. All these parameters can be tested in cultures of HDF after their exposure to UVA. If UVA rays are screened out by a sunscreen film placed on top of the cells, but not in contact with them, as in the experimental model used here, then these parameters will be positively affected. Indeed, the results obtained in our study demonstrate that the formulations containing the two UV filters tested individually, are able to filter out the UVA rays thus affecting the cellular and molecular endpoints considered. In fact, the results obtained when the formulation containing no UV filter was used, were similar to the positive control, i.e. no formulation. This model may mimic what should actually happen in practice when sunscreen is spread on skin. Sunscreens should not penetrate the skin and be systemically absorbed, but should be present as a uniform layer on top of the skin in order to consistently screen out harmful UV rays from penetrating within. Furthermore, not only the screening efficiency is tested, but simultaneously, after UVA exposure, the possible photodegradation of the UV filters present in the formulations prepared can be evaluated. Through solvent extraction and UV absorbance measurements, any changes before and after UVA irradiation can be easily observed and correlated with the endpoints investigated. The results reported in this study show that out of all the five possible UV filters synthesized, only two resulted completely photostable (BOX 2 and BOX 4) when incorporated in liposomes. The photostability of BOX 2 was then tested further by formulating it and comparing it with formulated BMDBM. The photostability of BOX 2 observed in liposomes was confirmed in the formulation. The greater photostability of BOX 2 and the broader UV absorbance spectrum compared to BMDBM, is the most likely explanation for the higher protective effects observed when the former UV filter was used in the formulation to protect the underlying HDF against UVA-induced damage. This is in line with the work of Lejeune et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Lejeune1">[48]</xref> who demonstrated by using human reconstructed skin <italic>in vitro</italic>, that efficient daily protection requires a high UVA filtration level which cannot be compensated by a high SPF value of a sunscreen. There are only a few other reports in the literature where sunscreen solutions or sunscreens have been applied on quartz slides/petri dishes or in between two quartz slides and placed over cell microplates of the same dimensions and irradiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Jean1">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083401-Vielhaber1">[51]</xref>. Almost all of them have mainly focused on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, particularly MMP-1, and only some have looked at UVA-induced DNA damage to evaluate sunscreen efficacy. In the present report not only expression of MMP-1 has been considered, but also that of COL1A1, which is just as determinant in skin photoageing as metalloproteinases. In addition, other biologically relevant endpoints related to the damaging effects of UVA on human skin fibroblasts were investigated (DNA integrity, intracellular ROS production, cell viability, mitochondrial function). Although all the information from an <italic>in vitro</italic> or from an <italic>in vivo</italic> method cannot be obtained for sunscreen global protection, the methods here employed do however give the essential information and the real possibility to test, compare and classify suncare products and individual UV filters, without being affected by anti-inflammatory ingredients present in current sunscreen products. Their photostability and ability to reduce the quantity of UVA rays reaching dermal skin cells can be determined, which is reflected in the protection of relevant biological parameters. Because the general trend in Europe and probably elsewhere in the future, is to replace human testing with <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, then more studies are needed to validate and standardize methods for measuring <italic>in vitro</italic> sun protection. It is by bearing this in mind, that the present study was carried out with the aim to obtain as much meaningful information as possible on the efficacy of suncare products by using simple <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques. Lastly, the new UV filters synthesized could be considered for future applications in the field of UV protection, which is not only confined to the cosmetic field, but also to other fields, such as polymers, plastics, paints and textiles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Drs.
