The effect of 2 hypoxic cell radiosensitizers, misonidazole and NDPP, on the O2 consumption of Ehrlich ascites tumour cells was compared in media with and without glucose. A stimulatory effect on O2 consumption was found for 5--20mM misonidazole as well as for 0.5mM NDPP, both in media containing 10(-2)M glucose. Thus glucose induced a Crabtree effect in Ehrlich tumour cells, expressed as 38--45% inhibition of O2 consumption relative to that in the same medium without glucose. The stimulatory effect of misonidazole and NDPP on O2 utilization in medium with glucose undoubtedly appeared as a release from the Crabtree effect.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00142-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="295" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00142-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="296" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00142-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="297" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00142-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="298" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00142-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="299" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
