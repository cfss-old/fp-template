It selectively accumulates in spheroids and is also used as a photosensitizer in the photodynamic therapy of cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of Hyp-mediated photodynamic therapy (Hyp-PDT) on cell growth and apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells, and to examine the underlying mechanisms. Hyp-PDT was performed with different light intensities (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), different concentrations of Hyp (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/ml) and different durations of irradiation (0, 2, 4 and 8 min) in order to select the optimal conditions for subsequent experiments. A concentration of 0.4 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/ml Hyp with a 5 h drug-light interval and 4 min irradiation at 0.3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensity was selected as the optimal conditions. The effects of Hyp-PDT on apoptosis were determined by detecting morphological changes under microscopy and by performing western blot analysis. The results revealed that Hyp-PDT suppressed cell viability in a light intensity-, dose- and irradiation duration-dependent manner. The expression levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3 and phosphorylated-C-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) l were significantly upregulated following Hyp-PDT. These results indicated that Hyp-PDT decreased cell viability and induced mitochondria-caspase-dependent apoptosis in the K562 cells through regulation of the JNK pathway. These findings suggest that Hyp-PDT may be developed as an effective treatment for leukemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>photodynamic therapy</kwd><kwd>hypericin</kwd><kwd>K562</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>C-Jun N terminal kinase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cytotoxic treatment induced by light interactions, cell or tissue molecular oxygen and photosensitizing molecules, termed the photosensitizer (PS) (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Once irradiated by visible light, the PS can react through two photo-oxidative pathways, classified as type I and type II (<xref rid="b2-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The type I pathway involves the generation of free radicals through PS or a substrate. These radicals react twith oxygen, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide nd hydroxyl radicals. In the type II pathway, the PS directly transfers energy to oxygen to produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, which induces apoptosis. These two pathways can lead to oxidative damage and ultimately to cell damage, including apoptotic, autophagic and/or necrotic cell death (<xref rid="b3-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PDT has been used for treating various types of malignancy, including bladder cancer, Barrett's esophagus, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and skin cancer (<xref rid="b4-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Compared with conventional cancer treatment modalities, PDT has several advantages, including high sensitivity to tumor tissues, minimal side effects and possible repetitive cycles of treatment, and the potential for combination with other forms of therapy, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<xref rid="b7-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Among the factors affecting the efficacy of PDT, PS is of importance. Hypericin (Hyp), with a typical naphthodianthrone structure, is the predominant active component of <italic>Hypericum</italic> species; commonly known as <italic>Hypericumperforatum</italic> or St. John's wort (<xref rid="b8-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For decades, Hyp has been used as a drug treatment for depression and viruses. It is also one of the most potent PSs, which has a maximum absorption peak of ~599 nm (<xref rid="b9-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and has several advantages over other PSs, including substantial quantum yield, intense absorption spectrum in the visible region, low photobleaching and a large excitation range (<xref rid="b10-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). At low concentrations, Hyp induces apoptosis mediated by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>; whereas, at high concentrations, it tends to induce necrosis via other ROS (<xref rid="b11-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although, it has not yet been approved for clinical application, several studies have demonstrated that Hyp-PDT has high tumor-specific cytotoxicity and minimal side effects (<xref rid="b12-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Physiologically, programmed cell death or apoptosis is important in eliminating aging and damaged cells. It is involved in development and tumorigenesis; and for the latter, cells lose their ability to undergo apoptosis due to a variety of environmental and genetic factors (<xref rid="b14-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, in addition to restricting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, promoting cancer cell apoptosis is also a valid approach in cancer therapy. It has been demonstrated that apoptosis, secondary to the increase in ROS, is a predominant mechanism of action in Hyp-PDT, and it has been suggested that the mitochondrial-mediated (intrinsic) pathway (<xref rid="b15-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and the death receptor-mediated (extrinsic) pathway (<xref rid="b16-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) are involved in Hyp-PDT-induced apoptosis.</p><p>However, the efficacy and safety of Hyp-PDT in leukemia treatment remains to be fully elucidated. Hyp selectively accumulates in spheroids (<xref rid="b17-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In our previous preliminary experiment, it was observed that Hyp-PDT in the extracorporeal circulation of normal Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in marked white blood cell reduction, while red blood cells generally remained intact. Therefore, it was hypothesized that Hyp-PDT may be developed as a novel therapy for leukemia, if the efficacy and safety can be demonstrated in clinical relevant models. In the present study, the K562 cell line was established from the pleural effusion of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at the blast crisis phase. With a high activity of BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase, the K562 cell has been reported to resist the induction of apoptosis by several stimuli (<xref rid="b18-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The present study aimed to demonstrate the influence that Hyp-PDT had on K562 leukemia cells and the possible pathway involved, so as to investigate an effective treatment or complementary therapy for leukemia, including for patients with CML in blast crisis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Hyp with a purity of 95% and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cell lysates were then prepared, and total proteins were extracted at various time-points (prior to irradiation, and 4, 8, and 16 h post-irradiation). Western blot analysis was then performed. In brief, the K562 cells were gently washed thee times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysate buffer containing 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mmol/l of NaF for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 7,200 &#x000d7; g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the supernatants were collected. Equal quantities of protein (40 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (0.05%; TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 15 min with TBST 3 times, the membrane was immunoblotted with antibodies against JNK, p-JNK, caspase 9, caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 at 4&#x000b0;C overnight.

Hyp-PDT with 0.3 and 0.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensities significantly decreased cell viability at different time-points post-irradiation (all P&#x0003c;0.01). However, the decrease in cell viability was only observed 4 h post-irradiation with a 0.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensity (P&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, cell viability at low light intensity (0.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was marginally increased following longer incubation periods (8 and 16 h post-irradiation); however, the differences were not statistically significant. According to the results above, Hyp-PDT with 0.3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensity exhibited significant but moderate cell damage and was selected for the subsequent experiments.

Cell viability decreased to 5% in the presence of 0.8 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/ml Hyp, following 8 min of irradiation with 0.3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensity (<xref rid="f1-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="f2-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the effects were minimal at a low light intensity (0.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), low Hyp concentration (0.2 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/ml) and short irradiation duration (2 min). A Hyp concentration of 0.4 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/ml with a 5 h drug-light interval, 4 min irradiation duration and 0.3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light intensity were selected for subsequent experiments; as these conditions resulted in significant but moderate cell damage, and the side effects were significantly reduced. The reduction in cell population reduction and morphological changes observed under a light microscope confirmed the cell cytotoxicity results.</p><p>Furthermore, the condensation and loss of intracellular details observed in the cells under an electron microscope clearly demonstrated that apoptosis occurred following Hyp-PDT. In accordance with these cellular structural changes, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 significantly increased following Hyp-PDT. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases and are key mediators of apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that Hyp-PDT-induced apoptosis is predominantly executed via the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic cascade and can be triggered directly at the mitochondria (<xref rid="b21-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) or by the endoplasmic reticulum-stress response (<xref rid="b22-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As verified using a cDNA macroarray and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, A-431 human squamous carcinoma cells undergo apoptosis within 1.5&#x02013;8 h following Hyp-PDT (<xref rid="b23-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This was confirmed through the reduction in extracellular signal transduction, cell detachment changes in cytoskeletal morphology, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Following the production of ROS, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis is induced by Hyp-PDT (<xref rid="b24-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As a key step in endogenous apoptosis, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is released from the mitochondria through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, under the regulation of molecular signals, including members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 family (<xref rid="b25-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the presence of dATP, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> combines with apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) to form an apoptosome with APAF-1 and pro-caspase-9; and the latter is activated to cleaved caspase-9 (<xref rid="b26-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This can efficiently split the downstream apoptotic executioner caspase-3 to its active sub-units, and eventually induce apoptosis (<xref rid="b21-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the present study, changes in cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 indicated that Hyp-PDT also induced potent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the K562 human leukemia cells.</p><p>Apoptosis is a complex process involving various cellular factors and pathophysiologic pathways. As an indispensable component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, JNK is important in regulating apoptosis (<xref rid="b27-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The JNK pathway is activated predominantly by cell stressors, including ultraviolet radiation, heat shock and oxidative stress; as well as by proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (<xref rid="b27-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Based on different cell types and stimuli, JNK may antipodally exert a pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effect in mammals (<xref rid="b28-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For example, genipin, an aglycone derived from geniposide, can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in K562 cells through JNK activation and induction of the Fas ligand (<xref rid="b29-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); and CMS-9, a phospholipase A2 isolated from <italic>Naja nigricollis</italic> venom, activates the JNK pathway and stimulates mitochondrial apoptosis (<xref rid="b30-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The JNK inhibitor, SP600125, has been reported to prevent the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and attenuate caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity (<xref rid="b31-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Hyp has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activities through attenuating the phosphorylation of JNK in rat peritoneal macrophages (<xref rid="b32-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Hyperoside, another active extract from <italic>Hypericumperforatum</italic>, can promote proliferation in ECV304 cells via the JNK pathway (<xref rid="b33-mmr-12-05-6475" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the association between JNK and Hyp-PDT remains to be fully elucidated. The present study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the levels of p-JNK were upregulated 4 h following Hyp-PDT, prior to any increases in the levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 were detected. The levels of p-JNK exhibited a marginal decrease at 8 and 16 h post-Hyp-PDT; however, the levels remained significantly higher than that of the control cells. It was hypothesized that the early increase in p-JNK, prior to changes in cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, indicated that activation of the JNK pathway is the upstream regulator of Hyp-PDT-induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic investigations are required in order to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from the present study demonstrated that Hyp-PDT decreased cell viability in a light-intensity-, Hyp dose-, and irradiation-time-dependent manner. Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was responsible for cell death, and activating the JNK pathway may be an important regulator. With the development of fiber-optic technology, laser medicine and extracorporeal circulation techniques, Hyp-PDT may be used as a novel therapeutic approach for leukemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81200513), the Qianjiang Talents Project of Technology Office of Zhejiang Province (grant no. 2011R10049) and Wenzhou Science &#x00026; Technology Public Welfare Project (grant no.
