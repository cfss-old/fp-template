A particularly interesting aspect of obesity is the differences observed in response to the same high-fat diet (HFD). In this study, we performed lipidomic profiling on livers from HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice using ultra-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mice were divided into three groups: normal diet (ND), HFD-obesity prone (HFD-OP), and HFD-obesity resistant (HFD-OR). Principal components analyses showed a difference between the HFD-OP and HFD-OR groups. Individuals in the HFD-OR group were closer to those in the ND group compared with those in the HFD-OP group. In particular, phosphocholine (PC) and triglyceride (TG) levels differed significantly depending on the length of the acyl chain and degree of unsaturation, respectively. PC species were either positively or negatively correlated with concentrations of glucose, insulin, leptin, and hepatic cholesterol according to the length of the acyl chain. Decreased expression of the scavenger receptor B1 and ATP-binding cassette A1 in HFD-OP mice indicated that the acyl chain length of PC species may be related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism. This study demonstrates that lipidomic profiling is an effective approach to analyzing global lipid alterations as they pertain to obesity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Obesity rates have increased dramatically in recent years to become a serious health problem. Obesity is known to contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Environmental influences like the excessive intake of fat and decreases in physical exercise may be key factors leading to obesity.</p><p>However, not all individuals become obese even when consuming a high-fat diet (HFD). Certain humans become obese (obesity-prone, OP), whereas others do not (obesity-resistant, OR), even when provided with the same HFD, indicating a difference in the metabolic response to HFD. Recent studies have suggested that a large number of factors, including differential regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism-related genes, changes in the expression levels of liver proteins, and metabolic adaptation, are important contributors to phenotypic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, no lipid profiling studies have clearly demonstrated differences in lipid levels or lipid speciation.

Although shotgun lipidomics is rapid and experimentally simple, it suffers from the risk of ion suppression and limitations in resolving isobaric compounds. In contrast, ion suppression and isobaric lipids are less of an issue for lipidomics using LC-MS. In particular, ultra-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;quadrupole time-of-flight MS (UPLC/QTOF MS), boasts high separation performance, increased sensitivity, high resolution, and the ability to characterize complex lipid species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Lipid profiling of HFD-induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice was performed to reveal differences in the levels of specific molecular lipid species in the livers of HFD-induced OP (HFD-OP) and OR (HFD-OR) phenotypes using UPLC/QTOF MS analyses of liver tissues.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals and biochemical characteristics</title><p>Mice used in this study were randomly divided into two groups, with 10&#x02009;mice fed a normal diet (ND) and 20&#x02009;mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The HFD-fed mice were subdivided into HFD obesity-prone (HFD-OP) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) or HFD obesity-resistant (HFD-OR) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) groups, based on their body weight gain. The changes in body weight among ND, HFD-OP, and HFD-OR mice during the feeding duration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. At the beginning, all groups had comparable body weights. After 2 weeks of feeding, the HFD-OP mice were significantly heavier than mice in the other groups and increased in weight consistently until 12 weeks. The HFD-OR mice were significantly heavier than the ND mice after 6 weeks and continued to gain weight until 12 weeks. The average energy intake did not differ between HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas the feed-efficiency ratio of HFD-OP mice was significantly higher than that of HFD-OR mice (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Body weight gain was highest in the HFD-OP mice, followed by HFD-OR and ND mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Body weight gain in HFD-OP mice was significantly higher than that in HFD-OR mice (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The total white adipose tissue weight per body weight for HFD-OP mice was significantly higher than that for HFD-OR mice (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Liver weight was also highest in the HFD-OP mice and differed significantly between the HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p>Liver lipid deposition and hepatic steatosis was monitored in each group using hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g-i</xref>). ND mice had no lipid deposition in the liver and exhibited normal tissue morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Conversely, HFD mice had higher proportions of lipid droplets and developed steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning in the liver. Lipid deposition and inflammatory cell infiltrates and hepatocyte degeneration was more extensive in the liver of HFD-OP mice compared with HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>,i). The development of hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Masson&#x02019;s trichrome staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j&#x02013;l</xref>). Collagen deposition and the development of hepatic fibrosis in necrotic areas of liver tissues were also higher in HFD-OP mice compared with HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>,l). Among the HFD mice, the plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice differed significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m</xref>,n).</p><p>The biochemical characteristics of ND, HFD-OP, and HFD-OR mice are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. In plasma, the concentrations of total cholesterol (total-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were higher in HFD-OP mice than in HFD-OR mice. The levels of apolipoprotein A1 (apo-A1) in the HFD-OP mice were similar to those in the HFD-OR mice. The levels of glucose, insulin, and leptin and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were also significantly elevated in the HFD-OP mice. The concentration of triglycerides (TGs) was highest in HFD-OR mice plasma, followed by ND and HFD-OP mice. In liver tissues, hepatic TGs and hepatic cholesterol levels were significantly higher in HFD-OP mice than in HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate hepatic insulin resistance, we analyzed Akt phosphorylation in liver.

The PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>,b) and PLS-DA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a,b</xref>) score plots show a significant separation among the three groups. The PCA models were established using five components in both positive (R2X&#x02009;=&#x02009;68.3%, Q2&#x02009;=&#x02009;49.5%) and negative modes (R2X&#x02009;=&#x02009;60.3%, Q2&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.0%). In both modes, the ND mice were separated from the HFD mice by the first component. The PCA score plot also shows that the HFD-OR mice were closer to the ND mice than to the HFD-OP mice. PLS-DA models were used to maximize the lipid metabolite pattern among the groups. The PLS-DA score plots showed a clear separation between the HFD-OP and HFD-OR groups in both positive and negative mode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a,b</xref>).</p><p>A VIP score of &#x0003e;1 in the PLS-DA model and independent t-tests were used as selection criteria to determine the specific lipid species associated with the differentiation of HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice liver tissues.

PC and TG levels in liver were higher or lower in the HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice depending on the acyl chain length and the degree of unsaturation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The levels of PC species with relatively long acyl chains (&#x0003e;36 carbon atoms) were relatively low, and the levels of PC species with short acyl chains (&#x0003c;34 carbon atoms) were relatively high in HFD-OR mice. Levels of PC species with high degrees of unsaturation, such as PC 40:9 and PC 38:7, were high in HFD-OR mice despite long acyl chain lengths. The levels of TG species having low degrees of unsaturation (&#x0003c;4) were high in the HFD-OP groups compared with the HFD-OR mice. Conversely, HFD-OR mice had higher levels of TG species with high degrees of unsaturation (&#x0003e;4).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Correlations of PC species with biochemical parameters</title><p>Correlations between identified PC species and the biochemical parameters of plasma and liver tissues were determined in both HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice. Representative Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlations for PC 32:4 and PC 40:6 with different biochemical characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. Glucose concentrations were negatively correlated with short acyl chain lengths, and PC 32:4 was lower in HFD-OP mice than in HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Conversely, glucose concentrations were positively correlated with long acyl chain lengths and was higher for PC 40:6 in HFD-OP mice than in HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The levels of insulin, leptin, and hepatic cholesterol were correlated in the same way as glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4b&#x02013;d,f&#x02013;h</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref> shows the positive correlation between long PC acyl chain lengths and glucose, insulin, leptin, and hepatic cholesterol.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Decreased SR-B1 and ABCA1 hepatic protein levels and mRNA in HFD-OP mice</title><p>Previous studies have suggested that the HDL phospholipid acyl chain composition affects the efflux of cellular free cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Our results show that the levels of hepatic cholesterol correlated positively or negatively with PC levels, depending on whether the acyl chain of the PC species was long or short, respectively. We examined the effect of liver PC acyl chain length on the expression of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which are related to HDL-C metabolism. Western blot analyses showed that the expression of LCAT in plasma was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), whereas the expression levels of both SR-B1 and ABCA1 were markedly lower in the livers of HFD-OP mice compared with those of HFD-OR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The mRNA levels of ABCA1 and SR-B1 also trended lower in HFD-OP mice compared with HFD-OR mice; however, the differences were not statistically significant. These results indicate that differences exist in the capacity of cholesterol efflux between these two groups. In addition, the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway through quantitative PCR of SREBF1 and SREBF2 was examined, but there was no difference between HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In biological systems, lipids comprise cell membranes, determine membrane dynamics, help maintain energy homeostasis, and play important roles in cell signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, abnormal lipid metabolism is associated with diverse disease states. In the present study, we applied global lipid profiling to liver tissues to further clarify the metabolic differences between HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice. The mice were divided into HFD-OP or HFD-OR groups based on body weight distribution of HFD mice. Weights of the liver and total white-adipose tissue and levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, and total cholesterol showed significant differences between the HFD groups. In PCA score plots derived from UPLC/QTOF MS spectra, the ND mice and HFD mice were clearly distinguished. HFD-OR mice were closer to the ND mice compared with the HFD-OP mice, indicating that the lipid composition of HFD-OR mice liver was more similar to that of ND mice than that of HFD-OP mice. Levels of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerolipids differed significantly between HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice, and variations in their relative levels are associated with obesity.</p><p>The compositions and concentrations of lipids in rodent and human obesity models have been measured previously. Pietil&#x000e4;inen <italic>et al.</italic> profiled lipids in monozygotic twins and showed upregulated levels of lysoPC and downregulated levels of ether phospholipids in the sera of obese twins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Barber <italic>et al.</italic> reported that levels of lysoPC species in mouse plasma decreased, and that levels of SM and Cer increased after 1 week of being fed a HFD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Several reports, however, provide conflicting results with regard to the lipid composition of liver tissues in specimens fed an HFD. Lipid profiling of liver tissues has shown elevated levels of TG and Cer species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In contrast, Eisinger <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> reported normal SM levels, whereas monounsaturated Cer and hexosylceramide levels decreased along with lower concentrations of PC, PE, and PS species. Thus, non-uniform changes in lipid composition occurring in various obesity models is not surprising. We also monitored changes in the levels of several lipid classes in HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice. The concentrations of some lipid species agreed with previous results, whereas others did not. Note that elucidating changes in lipid species is complicated by the many types of obesity models. Furthermore, only one lipid metabolite of each lipid class was identified, such as PI 38:3, PS 38:6, or SM d34:2, and may not be representative of the entire class.</p><p>The total TG levels in both liver tissue and plasma generally increased in rodent and human obesity models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, the relative TG composition varied with the obesity model. In a diet-induced weight loss model, weight reduction in mice was associated with lower levels of TG containing saturated fatty acids, e.g., TG species with acyl chains 16:0/14:0/14:1, 16:0/16:0/16:0, 18:1/14:0/16:0, 16:0/18:0/16:0, 16:0/16:0/18:1, 18:1/16:0/16:1, and 16:0/18:1/18:0 relative to a control group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Levels of serum TG species in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease were positively associated with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid TGs and negatively associated with polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids such as PC, PE, and TG species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Levels of TG 52:2 and TG 54:3, which contain relatively short-chain fatty acids, were twofold higher in the ob/ob adipose tissue of HFD mice relative to wild-type mice. Also, the level of TG 54:6, which is composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids, decreased by 40% in ob/ob mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We found that the levels of TG species with less than four degrees of unsaturation were higher in HFD-OP mice than in HFD-OR mice, and that levels of TG species with greater than four degrees of unsaturation were higher in HFD-OR mice, showing that differences in the degree of saturation of TG species in the liver affect the individual response to HFD.</p><p>In the above results, the dependencies of PC levels on acyl chain length differed between the HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice. The acyl chain length of PC species can be correlated with differences in several classical plasma biochemical parameters. Acyl chain length correlated either positively or negatively with concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin, high levels of which were observed in HFD-OP mice. Matsuzaka <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> suggested that Elvovl6, a gene involved in the formation of long-chain fatty acids by encoding elongase, plays a role in the elongation of palmitate (16:0) to stearate (18:0). Mice deficient in <italic>Elvovl6</italic> showed lesser frequencies of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia and could regulate insulin sensitivity through adjustments in their hepatic fatty acid compositions. In addition, phospholipid chain length has an effect on pulmonary insulin absorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Therefore, PC acyl chain length can affect concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin. Increased proportions of short fatty acid PC species, such as those found in HFD-OR mice, may improve insulin and leptin regulation and enhance obesity resistance.</p><p>The levels of insulin and HOMA-IR were the same in HFD-OR and ND mice, whereas they were higher in HFD-OP mice, suggesting that HFD-OP mice possessed insulin resistance. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation also supported insulin resistance in HFD-OP mice. Although HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice consumed the same diet, only HFD-OP mice showed insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia-mediated increases in hepatic <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL). In states of insulin resistance, elevated insulin levels do not fully suppress the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which hydrolyzes free fatty acids from adipocyte TG and activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. As a result, an influx of fatty acids to the liver increases <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL). The accumulation of hepatic TG and the histology of liver tissues in HFD-OP mice also suggest the increase in DNL. Activation of HSL and LPL may result in lower levels of circulating TG in HFD-OP mice compared with HFD-OR mice by clearing TG-rich plasma lipoproteins and hydrolyzing the TG in adipocytes.</p><p>The present study also indicates that PC acyl chain length in the liver is associated with levels of hepatic cholesterol. HFD-OP mice showed higher levels of hepatic cholesterol and plasma total-C, which indicates that cholesterol metabolism was abnormal in the HFD-OP mice. In a previous study, the HDL phospholipid fatty acyl chain composition was shown to affect the efflux of cellular free cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Therefore, one can reasonably assume that PC acyl chain length may influence cholesterol efflux.</p><p>HDL-C acts as a reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the anti-atherogenic mechanism by which excess free cholesterol in peripheral tissues is transported to the liver for removal and recycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Despite higher levels of hepatic cholesterol and total-C, no changes in the plasma levels of apoA-1 and HDL-C were observed in the HFD-OP mice. The expression level of LCAT, which plays a central role in maintaining HDL-C levels in the plasma, was likewise unchanged, suggesting that free cholesterol was converted to cholesteryl esters (CE) by the enzyme LCAT and led to HDL maturation within the HDL particle.</p><p>The expression of both SR-B1 and ABCA1 was low in the livers of HFD-OP mice. SR-B1 is an integral membrane protein expressed abundantly in several tissues, including the liver, and is a major HDL-C receptor mediating the selective uptake of CE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. ABCA1 is a transporter central to the synthesis of HDL by mediating the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to lipoproteins. Hepatic ABCA1, the most important modulation factor of hepatic cholesterol efflux, induces pathways that regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> modulation of HDL phospholipid content affects SR-B1- and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. HDL phospholipids composed of long acyl chains showed lower capacities for the efflux of cellular free cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, the observed high proportions of long acyl chain PCs in HFD-OP mice liver may affect the levels of HDL phospholipids, causing abnormal HDL-C metabolism. Vergeer <italic>et al.</italic> reported that a mutation of SR-B1 in humans caused increased HDL-C levels and a reduced capacity for cholesterol efflux from macrophages without increasing the severity of atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which may explain why concentrations of HDL-C were higher in HFD-OP mice, whereas the HDL-C/total-C ratio (HTR) was higher in HFD-OR mice. Moreover, SR-B1 knockout mice showed increased levels of plasma cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Note that SR-B1 protects against atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The significant lipid deposition was observed in various tissues of ABCA1-KO mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In addition, overexpression of human ABCA1 in C57BL/6&#x02009;mice resulted in anti-atherogenic profile with decreased plasma cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and non HDL-C levels, but with increased HDL-C, apoA-I, and apoE levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Therefore, elevated ABCA1 expression in HFD-OR mice demonstrates that HFD-OR mice are more anti-atherogenic compared to HFD-OP mice, and it causes low levels of total cholesterol and non HDL-C and high level of HTR in HFD-OR mice. Our results therefore indicate that HFD-OP mice may be more vulnerable to atherosclerosis than HFD-OR mice.</p><p>SR-B1 and ABCA1 are also integral membrane proteins, and PC species are the primary components of cell membranes. Therefore, the PC composition of liver tissues may affect the expression of SR-B1 and ABCA1 since it is so similar to the PC composition of hepatocyte membranes.</p><p>This study was performed in mice livers, which are not entirely consistent with human NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nevertheless, the results from several lipidomics studies of humans with NAFLD or NASH are similar to those presented here. Puri <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> showed that polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids such as TG and PC were lower in NASH livers. Similarly, polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PE and PC species were reduced in cirrhotic human liver samples, whereas saturated, mono- and di-unsaturated fatty acid-containing PE and PC species were increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, this study adds to our understanding of NAFLD.</p><p>In conclusion, the liver tissues of HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice models were compared and characterized using lipid profiles to provide new insights into lipid metabolism. Significant differences in the relative concentration of lipid species were observed between HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice. This study showed that UPLC/QTOF MS-based lipid profiling is an effective analytical tool for the characterization of lipid composition in HFD-OP and HFD-OR mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
