It was discovered by Brewster, while studying light reflected from materials at different angles. This led to the first polarizers, based on Brewster's effect. Now, one of the trends in photonics is the study of miniaturized devices exhibiting similar, or improved, functionalities compared with bulk optical elements. In this work, it is theoretically predicted that a properly designed all-dielectric metasurface exhibits a generalized Brewster's effect potentially for any angle, wavelength and polarization of choice. The effect is experimentally demonstrated for an array of silicon nanodisks at visible wavelengths. The underlying physics is related to the suppressed scattering at certain angles due to the interference between the electric and magnetic dipole resonances excited in the nanoparticles. These findings open doors for Brewster phenomenon to new applications in photonics, which are not bonded to a specific polarization or angle of incidence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

In this way, the reflected light will only have electric field component parallel to the interface. Well-understood since the 1820s after the pioneering work of Fresnel, and experimentally known since the early 1810s from works of Malus and Brewster<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> (see also ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> for a succinct historical perspective), the Brewster's angle for homogeneous isotropic non-magnetic media can be defined as the angle for which Fresnel's reflection coefficient for <italic>p</italic>-polarized light (that is, with the electric field parallel to the plane of incidence) vanishes, <inline-formula id="d33e218"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e219" xlink:href="ncomms10362-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>. An alternative definition states that Brewster's angle is the one at which the reflected and refracted waves are orthogonal, thus fulfilling the condition <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>&#x0002b;<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>=<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/2, where <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the angle of incidence and <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the angle of refraction/transmission. The common microscopic interpretation of this effect is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. In response to the driving electromagnetic wave, electric dipoles are induced within the material. These dipoles oscillate along the direction of the electric field, that is, perpendicular to the propagation direction. As the far-field power radiated by a dipole vanishes along its oscillation axis, whenever the dipoles and the reflection direction are parallel, no radiation is emitted into that direction and reflection is inhibited. In all other directions apart from that of refraction, radiation is compensated by the rest of the dipoles within the medium. If polarization is switched, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, due to the non-zero radiation in the plane perpendicular to the dipole, it is clear that such effect cannot be achieved.</p><p>The situation becomes more interesting when one considers a material that has both electric and magnetic dipoles excited in response to the electric and magnetic components of the incident wave. Such materials should have both electric permittivity and magnetic permeability different from unity (<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>&#x02260;1, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>&#x02260;1). In this case, the radiation pattern is no longer zero in the direction of oscillation of any of the orthogonal electric or magnetic dipoles (due to the non-zero contribution of the orthogonal dipole) and thus the classical Brewster effect can no longer be observed. Instead, there can be other particular directions at which the collective radiation of both dipoles vanishes due to their destructive interference, as predicted by Kerker <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> in early 80s. These directions are determined by the relative amplitudes and phases of the dipoles. In the macroscopic picture, this interference may lead to the appearance of an analogue to Brewster's angle defined by both electric and magnetic properties of the material, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>. This is, the ratio <italic>&#x0025b;</italic>/<italic>&#x003bc;</italic> determines the angle at which the condition <inline-formula id="d33e278"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e279" xlink:href="ncomms10362-m2.jpg"/></inline-formula> is satisfied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. More importantly, inhibition of radiation from a pair of dipoles can happen at any angle and in any of the two oscillation planes depending on their relative amplitudes and phases. Thus, for such a material Brewster's angle may exist, potentially, for any of the two polarizations and at any angle of incidence (even below 45&#x000b0; without leading to total internal reflection at some higher angles). Both polarizations cannot, however, simultaneously have zero reflection for a given angle, except for the very particular case of <italic>&#x0025b;</italic>=<italic>&#x003bc;</italic> (impedance matched) at normal incidence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In this case, each polarizable portion of matter will have induced electric and magnetic dipoles having the same amplitude and phase leading to inhibition of backscattered radiation, that is, fulfilling the so-called first Kerker's condition, originally derived for small magnetic particles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In case of purely magnetic media, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>&#x02260;1 and <italic>&#x0025b;</italic>&#x02248;1, one can find a situation when the analogue to Brewster's angle appears for <italic>s</italic>-polarized light, having the magnetic field vector parallel to the plane of incidence, which is orthogonal to the conventional Brewster effect in dielectric media.</p><p>All this findings remained a mere theoretical curiosity for almost 20 years, since for natural materials the magnetic response is typically very weak at optical frequencies (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>&#x02248;1). Nevertheless, since the advent of metamaterials new ways to produce optical magnetic response have been explored<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. As a result some attempts have been done towards finding Brewster's angle in <italic>s</italic>-polarization in bulk magnetic metamaterials, both in microwaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> in arrays of split ring resonators and at optical frequencies in strongly anisotropic media<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Recently, polarization rotation in reflection from meta-films of bi-anisotropic split rings has been theoretically studied at microwave frequencies in connection to Brewster effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, it is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the generalized Brewster effect can be observed, potentially, in any two-dimensional (2D) sub-diffractive arrangement of high-index dielectric nanoparticles, or in any other system where strong electric and magnetic resonances can be efficiently excited. It is shown that this effect is a direct consequence of the angle-suppressed radiation/scattering due to interference between the electric and magnetic dipoles excited in the particles within the array, thus connecting two apparently unrelated phenomena such as Brewster's angle and general Kerker's conditions.

The present study comes to extend this already broad realm with new fascinating properties. Moreover, novel generalized Brewster phenomenon giving great degree of freedom in polarization and incident angles may open doors to multiple new applications in photonics, which could not be achieved with standard Brewster effect in conventional dielectric media.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generalized Brewster effect in arrays of silicon spheres</title><p>This section aims to show that the important phenomenology associated to the generalized Brewster effect (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and associated <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1, 2 and 3</xref> for a concise review of it) can be found in sub-diffractive, 2D arrays of silicon spheres. We will demonstrate that, in a similar way as in continuous medium with both electric and magnetic response, the suppression of reflection originates from the interference between electric and magnetic dipoles induced in the particles in the array, as schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>. For this purpose, let us first start considering a single silicon nanosphere under plane wave illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), for which the required electric and magnetic dipole modes can be efficiently excited.

Partial scattering cross-sections by the first excited resonant modes, namely the electric and magnetic dipoles and the electric and magnetic quadrupoles are also shown.

It is clear that for <italic>p</italic>-polarized light the plane of incidence coincides with the plane that contains the incident electric field and the induced electric dipoles (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Correspondingly, for <italic>s</italic>-polarization the incidence plane contains the magnetic field and the induced magnetic dipoles (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Although the effective dipoles induced in the particles in the array are different from the single particle case owing to the lattice interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, they still radiate according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3">equations (1)&#x02013;(3)</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq6"/>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq7"/> in the plane of incidence. Note that interference from different sites in the infinite array makes radiation of the whole system allowed only as plane waves along the diffraction directions. In the case of sub-diffractive arrays, this implies radiation in the reflection and transmission directions only. Therefore, if the induced dipoles do not radiate along the direction of reflection, no reflection at all will occur in the system, leading to the Brewster's condition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>, and the associated <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, for a demonstration in the context of phased arrays). Following the discussion above, in such systems this may happen for both <italic>s</italic>- and <italic>p</italic>-polarized incident waves.</p><p>In the following, we consider an infinite square lattice of silicon spheres with diameter <italic>D</italic>=180&#x02009;nm and period <italic>P</italic>=300&#x02009;nm, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, and study its reflection properties as a function of the wavelength and angle of incidence. We start with <italic>p</italic>-polarized light. Simulated results obtained by means of finite element method (see Methods section for details) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>. At normal incidence, the electric and magnetic resonances of the particles lead to the appearance of well-known bands of high reflectivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, oblique incidence strongly changes this behaviour. At high angles of incidence one can observe three regions of extremely low reflection. Light-white, dashed lines, with numbering ranging from 1 to 3 are included in the figure as guides to the eye to ease their location and referencing. The first one is a narrow region located at the blue side of the resonances (&#x0223c;515&#x02009;nm). It is present at normal incidence and slightly redshifts for increasing angles (from 0 up to &#x0223c;40&#x000b0;). The second one, located in the red side of the resonances (&#x0223c;790&#x02009;nm), is also present at normal incidence and strongly redshifts with increasing angles. Finally, a broad region, both in bandwidth (&#x0223c;150&#x02009;nm) and angles of incidence (from &#x0223c;40 to &#x0223c;80&#x000b0;), appears at higher angles, spectrally located between the positions of the electric and magnetic dipole resonances observed at normal incidence. Importantly, the angle of minimum reflection strongly depends on the wavelength and varies in the wide range. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> shows the angular dependence of reflection at some selected wavelengths to better illustrate this effect. One can observe that reflection of <italic>p</italic>-polarized light (solid lines) turns into zero at some particular angle of incidence, resembling the conventional Brewster effect in dielectric media, while no special features are observed for <italic>s</italic>-polarized light at this angle (corresponding dashed lines). However, there are two major peculiarities of this system, which should be highlighted. First, the range of angles at which the reflection minimum is observed covers almost the whole 0&#x02013;90&#x000b0; span, not being restricted to angles above 45&#x000b0; (opposite to the conventional Brewster effect). Second, as will be shown next, the effect is not restricted to <italic>p</italic>-polarization, thus gathering the main features of generalized Brewster phenomenon. It is important to mention that this effect is not related to diffraction. The first non-zero diffraction order, indicated as a dashed white line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and as shaded regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, appears out of the range of wavelengths and angles for which the effect is observed.</p><p>Let us now focus on the spectral region between the electric and magnetic dipole resonances. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d&#x02013;g</xref> the case of normal incidence is shown, together with some cases with zero reflection in that region, namely 45, 60 and 75&#x000b0; incidence. For normal incidence both reflection maxima spectrally coincide with the excitation of dipolar resonances inside the particles. Zero reflection is observed at 775&#x02009;nm, where the induced electric and magnetic dipoles have the same amplitudes and phases meeting the first Kerker's condition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and at 515&#x02009;nm, which is close to the Kerker's condition but also affected by higher-order contributions. In the cases of oblique incidence, zeros in reflection are observed at 566&#x02009;nm for 45&#x000b0;, 657&#x02009;nm for 60&#x000b0;, and 686&#x02009;nm for 75&#x000b0; (indicated by arrow heads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d&#x02013;g</xref>) showing the strong wavelength dependence.</p><p>One explanation of the emergence of the reflection minimum at higher angles could be associated with disappearance of the dipolar resonances at off-normal incidence. However, this is not the case. Both dipolar modes are still efficiently excited, and it is their mutual interference which results in the radiation inhibition in the reflection direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3d&#x02013;g</xref> show by red and blue curves (and corresponding shaded areas), the electric dipole and magnetic dipole contributions to the total scattering cross-section (<italic>C</italic><sub>sca</sub>) from each single particle in the array, computed using the multipole decomposition technique, as explained in Methods section. As readily seen, both dipole modes are present for those angles and wavelengths for which the reflection vanishes. The dipolar contributions are dominant and higher-order modes only appear at shorter wavelengths (the complete map can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). Interestingly, multipole decomposition reveals that the electric dipole dominates in all the above cases. This is expected from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq11">equation (4)</xref> to be able to cancel radiation in the plane containing the electric field, which in <italic>p</italic>-polarized case coincides with the plain of incidence. In a simplified case with no interaction between the particles in the array, the induced dipoles should oscillate parallel to the incident field. In that case, to cancel scattering at the reflection angle <italic>&#x003b8;</italic>=<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>r</sub>=&#x02212;<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>i</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq11">equation (4)</xref> imposes <inline-formula id="d33e738"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e739" xlink:href="ncomms10362-m15.jpg"/></inline-formula> for <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>i</sub>={45, 60, 75} degrees, respectively. Thus, usual Brewster at 45&#x000b0; is covered in this description and requires vanishing of magnetic dipole for <italic>p</italic>-polarization, as expected. Actual values retrieved from simulations, in which interparticle interaction is taken into account, become <inline-formula id="d33e749"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e750" xlink:href="ncomms10362-m16.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which are quite close to the interaction-free case. The second zero in reflection observed at 560&#x02009;nm for <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>i</sub>=60&#x000b0; is related to the onset of the diffractive regime (indicated as grey-shaded areas).</p><p>As a test of consistency, far-field radiation patterns from each single particle in the infinite array were computed using Stratton&#x02013;Chu formulas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> from the fields on the surface of the sphere and plotted in the plane of incidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h&#x02013;k</xref> (blue solid lines). Also shown (red dashed lines) are the patterns radiated by the pair of electric <bold>p</bold> and magnetic <bold>m</bold> dipoles given by the multipole decomposition, computed through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3">equation (1)</xref>. Both patterns closely coincide and show zero radiation in the direction of the reflected wave (indicated, together with the incident one by arrows), thus confirming the dipole interference origin of the vanishing reflection regions.</p><p>Let us now switch to the case of <italic>s</italic>-polarized incidence (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) to show that similar effects can be obtained. The change in polarization makes the plane of incidence coincide with that containing the magnetic field in the analysis for a single sphere, thus obeying <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq7">equations (3)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq12">(5)</xref>. The simulated reflection versus wavelength and angle of incidence for the same array of spheres in <italic>s</italic>-polarized case is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>. Two narrow band frequency windows of vanishing reflection, shifting very weakly with the angle of incidence, can be observed starting at &#x0223c;515 and 770&#x02009;nm for normal incidence, indicated by the light-white, dashed lines with numbers 1 and 2, respectively. Also, an omni-directional, high-reflectivity region is observed in between, analogous to that reported for high-index infinite cylinders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Brewster effect in this polarization is evidenced by plotting, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, the reflection against the angle of incidence for several wavelengths. We focus on the narrow band 2, observed between 700 and 750&#x02009;nm, for which no higher-order multipoles are present. For <italic>s</italic>-polarized light (shown as solid lines) emergence of Brewster's angle is apparent, while no special features are observed for <italic>p</italic>-polarization (dashed lines). As readily observed, strong dependence on wavelength and span over the whole 0&#x02013;80&#x000b0; simulated range are also observed for <italic>s</italic>-polarization.</p><p>Now we show that the origin of Brewster's angle in this polarization is totally analogous to that of <italic>p</italic>-polarization. To this end, particular angles are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> together with the electric dipole and magnetic dipole partial scattering cross-sections (normalized to their common maximum). For normal incidence spectral position of the dip corresponds to the first Kerker's condition at which electric and magnetic dipoles have similar amplitude and phases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The observed weak blue-shift of this dip with increased angle of incidence is a consequence of the particular shape of the resonances excited in the particles and their mutual interplay, which allows fulfilling <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq12">equation (5)</xref> for every angle in a narrow spectral region. Note that within the whole range of wavelengths and angles with vanishing reflection, the magnetic dipole contribution is higher than the electric dipole one, as predicted by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq12">equation (5)</xref>. Similar to the case of <italic>p</italic>-polarized incidence, the radiation patterns of each single particle in the array associated with zero-reflection wavelengths show no radiation in the reflection direction, thus confirming the interference origin of the effect also in <italic>s</italic>-polarization as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>.</p><p>It is important to stress that the observed spectral and angular behaviour of the zero-reflection regions in the metasurface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4b</xref>) can be directly related to the scattering properties of the single building-blocks through amplitudes and phases of the induced dipoles, as described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref> (and associated <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6 and 7</xref>). Thus, engineering these parameters, for example, through the geometry of the inclusions, could lead to the generalized Brewster effect, potentially, at any desired angle, frequency and polarization of interest.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental verification with arrays of silicon nanodisks</title><p>To experimentally demonstrate the generalized Brewster effect, an array of silicon nanodisks was fabricated on a fused silica substrate (as described in Methods section) through silicon film deposition, electron-beam lithography and etching.

The actual diameter is around <italic>D</italic>=180&#x02009;nm, height <italic>H</italic>=150&#x02009;nm and array pitch <italic>P</italic>=300&#x02009;nm (see SEM images of the fabricated array in the insets to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Angular-dependent reflection measurements were performed using a home-built free-space microscopy set-up (see Methods section for details). The measured reflection and transmission spectra under normal incidence are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> as blue and red lines, respectively.</p><p>Reflection measurements as a function of the angle of incidence for several wavelengths in the spectral region covering both electric and magnetic dipole resonances are presented as solid circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> for <italic>p</italic>- (red) and <italic>s</italic>-polarized light (blue), together with results of numerical simulations (corresponding solid lines). The best agreement with the experiment was achieved for simulated diameter <italic>D</italic>=170&#x02009;nm, height <italic>H</italic>=160&#x02009;nm, pitch <italic>P</italic>=300&#x02009;nm and substrate refractive index of 1.45. The origin of the small discrepancy between the experiment and simulations is due to a difference between the refractive index of the fabricated silicon and the tabulated data for &#x003b1;-silicon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> used in the simulations, suggesting that the fabricated silicon has less dissipation than that commonly found in literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref> for details). For <italic>p</italic>-polarization, it is clearly observed the appearance of a zero-reflection angle showing strong wavelength dependence and ranging from &#x0223c;25 to nearly 70&#x000b0; in the studied frequency range, that is, going well below 45&#x000b0;. For those values below 45&#x000b0; no sign of total internal reflection is found. These results are strongly different from conventional Brewster's angle behaviour and represent the first experimental demonstration of the generalized Brewster effect in arrays of particles with both electric and magnetic responses. Numerical simulations, shown as solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, closely reproduce the experimental values and demonstrate excellent agreement in the position of the minima. The slight differences in the reflection intensity, as mentioned, are due to the smaller absorption of the deposited silicon compared with the common amorphous silicon data from literature used in simulations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Taking in simulations slightly lower values of the imaginary part of refractive index than in Palik<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (as given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) leads to almost perfect agreement to the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>To complete the picture, the full simulated maps of reflection of <italic>p</italic>- and <italic>s</italic>-polarized light as a function of angle of incidence and wavelength are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>. Although with some differences, the general trend observed in the simulated region strongly resembles that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4a</xref> for spheres. For <italic>p</italic>-polarized light, the minimum in reflection strongly varies both with wavelength and angle of incidence, starting in the blue side of the resonances and moving into the region between them for increasing angles. As in the case of spheres both electric dipole and magnetic dipole modes retrieved from multipole decomposition for single disk in the array are strongly excited in the regions of zero reflection (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).

These minima correspond to the tail of the vanishing reflection region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) and provide further experimental evidence of the generalized Brewster effect. Discussion of the experimental plot focused on the cases of 755 and 775&#x02009;nm can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>, clearly showing a minimum in reflection for angles below and above 45&#x000b0;. It is worth mentioning that for this particular system the complete vanishing of reflection under <italic>s</italic>-polarized incidence can be obtained in the spectral region &#x0223c;850&#x02009;nm. However, at these wavelengths the array has very low reflectivity even at normal incidence.</p><p>Remarkably, even for the realistic system described above the generalized Brewster effect is very robust and can easily be detected in experiment, the only true requirement being the efficient excitation of electric and magnetic dipole resonances in the particles forming a sub-diffractive array.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>According to the results shown, sub-diffractive arrays of high-permittivity dielectric nanoparticles supporting both electric and magnetic dipole resonances present a form of generalized Brewster effect leading to vanishing reflection at particular wavelengths and angles both under <italic>p</italic>- and <italic>s</italic>-polarized incidence. The phenomenon can be explained in terms of radiation interference between the electric and magnetic dipoles induced in each particle in the array and connects the angle-suppressed scattering from magneto-electric particles (usually studied in relation to first Kerker's condition) with the zero-reflection (Brewster effect) observed in 2D arrangements of such particles. As a consequence of this interference the range of zero-reflection angles spans almost over the entire 0&#x02013;90&#x000b0; without implying total internal reflection. It shows a strong dependence on the incident wavelength and is present for both <italic>p</italic> and <italic>s</italic> polarizations. The effect has been experimentally demonstrated in dense arrays of silicon disks over a fused silica substrate, with measured zero-reflection angles ranging from 20 to 70&#x000b0; for wavelengths varying from 590 to 775&#x02009;nm in the visible spectrum. These results represent the first experimental demonstration of the generalized Brewster's effect at optical frequencies in particle arrays with both electric and magnetic response to incident light.</p><p>Since this effect is a universal phenomenon related to the directional interference of resonances excited in the particles, it is foreseen that it will be observed in a variety of systems, provided they present electric and magnetic responses. Moreover, tuning the shape and material properties of the particles may lead to almost-on-demand Brewster's effect with regard to polarization, wavelength and angle of incidence. Taking advantage of the strongly resonant character of the structures may bring opportunities for design of efficient sub-wavelength-thick polarizers with a great degree of freedom.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numerical simulations</title><p>Finite element method was used to compute the reflection, transmission and absorption of light from infinite square arrays of silicon spheres (commercial COMSOL Multiphysics software was used). Experimentally measured values of the refractive index of crystalline silicon, taken from ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, were used in the simulations. The simulation domain consisted of a single unit cell with Bloch boundary conditions applied in the periodicity directions (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axes) to simulate an infinite lattice. The so-called scattered field formulation of the problem was used. The exciting field was defined as a plane wave with the electric field in the incidence plane for <italic>p</italic>-polarized light and perpendicular to it for <italic>s</italic>-polarized light. Perfectly matched layers were applied in the top and bottom directions to absorb all scattered fields from the system.
