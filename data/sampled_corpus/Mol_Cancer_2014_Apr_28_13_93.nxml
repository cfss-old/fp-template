[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been used extensively to analyze DNA copy number changes at a higher resolution, identifying recurrent chromosomal alterations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have previously identified a novel, frequent deletion in 3q13.31 in osteosarcomas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Of the genes located within the deleted region, three have been proposed to be involved in cancer biology: the protein-coding gene limbic system-associated membrane protein (<italic>LSAMP</italic>) and the two non-coding RNAs LSAMP RNA antisense 3 (<italic>LSAMP-AS3</italic>) (also known as <italic>LOC285194</italic> or <italic>TUSC7</italic>) and LSAMP RNA antisense 4 (<italic>LSAMP-AS4</italic>) (also known as <italic>BC040587</italic>)

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Kresse <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished) were investigated. We determined the minimal recurrent deletion to be from chr3:116,560,000-116,577,000 and present in 59% (45/76) of the samples (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), with a similar distribution across the different sample types (56% of the clinical samples (18/32), 64% of the xenograft samples (16/25) and 58% of the cell lines (11/19)). No differences were observed among the different osteosarcoma subtypes investigated, although the majority of the samples were of osteoblastic subtype (subtype information in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). The high frequency suggests that loss of 3q13.31 is important for development of osteosarcoma, and that the region may harbor tumor suppressor gene(s).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosome map and frequency plot of the observed deletions in 3q13.31 in osteosarcoma samples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;76).</bold> The shaded gray area (chr3:116,269,000-116,896,000) corresponds to a frequency of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30% of the samples.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To investigate whether loss of other genes besides <italic>LSAMP</italic> could be important, we performed gene expression analysis of LSAMP RNA antisense 1 (<italic>LSAMP-AS1</italic>), <italic>LSAMP-AS3</italic> and <italic>LSAMP-AS4</italic> in a panel of 5 osteosarcoma clinical samples, 13 xenograft samples, 19 cell lines and 14 control samples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;51).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Bar&#x000f8;y <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished).

A recurrent deletion within 3q13.31 has been identified
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This deletion has so far only been described in one other cancer type
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], indicating that it is highly specific to osteosarcomas. This specificity argues that the deletion is not due to a fragile site and strongly suggests involvement of this region in osteosarcoma development. Thus, the deleted region is likely to contain sequences preventing or retarding osteosarcoma development or progression.</p><p>The simplest interpretation would be that the region harbors one or more tumor suppressor genes. Concordantly, three genes located within the deleted region have been proposed to have tumor suppressive functions in osteosarcomas: <italic>LSAMP</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], <italic>LSAMP-AS3</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and <italic>LSAMP-AS4</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, our results showed either no or low expression levels of <italic>LSAMP-AS3</italic> and <italic>LSAMP-AS4</italic> in all the samples investigated, including the control samples. The control samples originated from osteoblastic cultures, bone, brain and smooth muscle. In addition, we included the Universal Human Reference RNA, which is a pool of RNA from ten different human cell lines representing various cancer types, excluding osteosarcoma. As neither <italic>LSAMP-AS3</italic> nor <italic>LSAMP-AS4</italic> were expressed in any of these control samples, it is reasonable to argue that the low or lack of expression in the osteosarcoma samples is not due to inactivation, but a normal state for both non-cancerous and cancerous cells. The other genes located within the deleted region (only annotated by ENSEMBL, supported by GENCODE/ENCODE) have been annotated only recently, and was thus not investigated in this study. However, stranded total RNA-sequencing data of 10 osteosarcoma cells lines and the non-tumorigenic cell line iMSC#3 (both undifferentiated and with osteogenic differentiation), showed no detectable expression corresponding to any of these genes (Meza-Zepeda <italic>et al.,</italic> unpublished). Even though we cannot exclude that other genes within the deleted region are important for the development of osteosarcomas, several lines of evidence indicate that <italic>LSAMP</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene and the target for the deletion in 3q13.31. DNA methylation of the promoter region has been described, indicating that <italic>LSAMP</italic> is epigenetically inactivated in cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and absent or low expression of <italic>LSAMP</italic> has been reported to be a frequent characteristic of osteosarcomas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have previously shown that expression of <italic>LSAMP</italic> is associated with poor survival in a larger panel of osteosarcoma patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and it has also been shown in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this study, we saw a trend towards poorer survival in patients with loss of <italic>LSAMP</italic> copy number, although not statistically significant, possibly due to the limited sample size (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18). Overexpression of <italic>LSAMP</italic> was shown to inhibit proliferation in a renal cell carcinoma cell line
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas depletion of <italic>LSAMP</italic> promoted cell proliferation in osteoblasts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the function of <italic>LSAMP</italic> to be a tumor suppressor gene. Our results add to these evidences as we showed reduced proliferation rate <italic>in vitro</italic> and inhibited tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> when the expression of <italic>LSAMP</italic> was restored.</p><p>By western blotting, we investigated whether the <italic>LSAMP</italic> transcript was translated, which to our knowledge has not been done in tumor samples. However, we did not find a clear correlation between the mRNA level of <italic>LSAMP</italic> and the protein level in our samples. Interestingly, one study has shown that in osteosarcomas with high mRNA levels of <italic>LSAMP,</italic> a premature termination codon was detected
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this is the cause for the apparent lack of translation in some of the samples. However, the premature termination codon was not found in any of 19 osteosarcoma cell lines based on available RNA-sequencing data (Meza-Zepeda <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished), indicating that this is not a frequent event of regulation in osteosarcomas. Taking into account that 11/23 clones transfected with <italic>LSAMP</italic> ORF failed to translate the transcripts to detectable levels, there could also be post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>LSAMP</italic>, even though these transcripts are lacking features of the endogenous mRNA. Also, as only the clones with detectable levels of the LSAMP protein had upregulated <italic>HES1, CTAG2</italic> and <italic>KLF10,</italic> our results indicate that the LSAMP protein is indirectly affecting the upregulation of these genes. However, it is also possible that the cells upregulated one or more of these genes to be able to grow in the presence of the <italic>LSAMP</italic> protein. On the other hand, there were no differential expression of these genes between the investigated samples with (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) and without (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) detectable levels of the LSAMP protein, based on mRNA expression profiling data (
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Kresse <italic>et al.,</italic> unpublished). This discrepancy could be explained by the relatively small size of the cohort with LSAMP protein. However, <italic>LSAMP</italic> is one of four IgLONs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which are cell adhesion molecules that function as dimers, referred to as Diglons
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. LSAMP has been shown to only function as heterodimers with either Opioid-binding cell adhesion molecule (OBCAM) or Neurotrimin (NTM)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. If the dimerization partner of LSAMP is not present, it would most likely not function properly. <italic>OBCAM</italic> was not expressed in any of the investigated samples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7 with LSAMP protein, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23 without LSAMP protein), but <italic>NTM</italic> was expressed at different levels. Furthermore, the non-transfected parental cell line IOR/OS14 had among the highest expression levels of <italic>NTM</italic> and ranking as number 11 out of the 30 samples (data not shown). Also, the majority of the cohort with LSAMP protein had low expression of <italic>NTM</italic>. Thus, it is possible that we do not find an upregulation of <italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>CTAG2</italic> and/or <italic>KLF10</italic> in these samples due to the lack of expression of a LSAMP dimerization partner.</p><p><italic>HES1, CTAG2</italic> and <italic>KLF10</italic> have all been shown to play a role in cancer biology. <italic>HES1</italic> has been suggested to have both oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whereas <italic>KLF10</italic> has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. <italic>CTAG2</italic> is mainly expressed in the reproductive organs, in addition to a variety of cancers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To our knowledge, the function of <italic>CTAG2</italic> is not known, but both <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>KLF10</italic> have been shown to be involved in bone biology. HES1 has been shown to bind to bone-specific promoters together with the runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and the retinoblastoma protein (RB)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. <italic>KLF10</italic> has been shown to have an impact on the proliferation of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteosarcoma cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which could be the cause for the observed reduced proliferation rate. In a recent study, <italic>LSAMP</italic> clustered together with pro-apoptotic genes when gene expression changes of osteosarcoma cell lines were analyzed after induction of apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, depletion of <italic>LSAMP</italic> in osteoblasts had an effect on the expression of the proapoptotic genes <italic>BCL2</italic> and <italic>BimEL</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although apoptosis could be a possible mechanism for <italic>LSAMP</italic> to suppress or delay tumors formation, we did not find evidence of apoptosis in our clones with <italic>LSAMP-</italic>reexpression<italic>.</italic> This is consistent with another study where <italic>LSAMP</italic> was overexpressed in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell line without any evidence of apoptotic cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The high frequency of the deletion in 3q13.31 and the specificity for osteosarcomas strongly suggest a functional role for this region and that it harbors a tumor suppressor gene important for the development of osteosarcomas. Our results indicate that among the genes investigated in 3q13.31, <italic>LSAMP</italic> is the target for the deletion. The function of <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>KLF10</italic> in bone biology also implies a function for these genes in osteosarcoma development. Furthermore, the reduced proliferation rate <italic>in vitro</italic> and inhibited tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> is further pointing to a tumor suppressor function of <italic>LSAMP</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified a frequent deletion in osteosarcomas and shown <italic>LSAMP</italic> to be the target gene within the deletion.
