The expression of miR-497 is decreased in malignant tumors, which suggests a role for miR-497 as a tumor suppressor. Angiomotin is encoded by the <italic>AMOT</italic> gene, which is a target for miR-497. Angiomotin has a role in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and invasion in human malignancies, including osteosarcoma. However, the role of miR-497 in human osteosarcoma is unknown. This preliminary study included human osteosarcoma tissues and normal tissues from 20 patients, the osteosarcoma cell lines, MG-63, SAOS-2, U-2 OS, and the human osteoblast cell line hFOB (OB3). Western blots for angiomotin and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of miR-497 and <italic>AMOT</italic> were performed. Knockdown studies were performed using RNA interference and transfection studies used miR-497 mimics. Quantitative cell migration assays were performed, and cell apoptosis was studied by flow cytometry. Osteosarcoma cells and cell lines showed reduced expression of miR-497 and increased expression of angiomotin. Transfection of osteosarcoma cells with miR-497 mimics suppressed the expression of angiomotin. Results from a dual-luciferase reporter system supported <italic>AMOT</italic> as a direct target gene of miR-497. Knockdown of <italic>AMOT</italic> using RNA interference resulted in inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These preliminary studies support a role for miR-497 as a suppressor of <italic>AMOT</italic> gene expression in human osteosarcoma cells, resulting in suppression of tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Further studies are recommended to investigate the role of miR-497 in osteosarcoma and other malignant mesenchymal tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>angiomotin</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cell migration and invasion</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>microRNA-497</kwd><kwd>osteosarcoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteosarcoma is one of the most common and destructive primary malignant tumors in children and young adults.<xref rid="b1-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by malignant osteoid production and malignant cells with osteoblastic differentiation.<xref rid="b2-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> During the past 25 years, the incidence of osteosarcoma has been reported to be increasing at a rate of 1.4% per year.<xref rid="b3-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Surgery is the standard initial treatment, but even with surgery, the prognosis remains poor.<xref rid="b4-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The 5-year survival rate of nonmetastatic osteosarcoma has been improving during the past 40 years to approximately 50%&#x02013;80%; this is due to the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide.

The role of miR-497 in osteosarcoma cell growth, migration, and apoptosis was studied using a variety of methods, including flow cytometry and apoptosis analysis and migration and invasion assays. In addition, transfection of miR-497 mimics inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro in the MG-63 cell line. These findings support a role for miR-497 in the invasive and metastatic potential of osteosarcoma. Although this is a small and preliminary study, the findings would support further laboratory and clinical studies, particularly as there is a requirement for diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in osteosarcoma.</p><p>The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that the <italic>AMOT</italic> gene is a direct target of miR-497 in human osteosarcoma. In this study, <italic>AMOT</italic> expression levels were increased in human osteosarcoma tumor cells when compared with patient-matched normal tissues; levels of the <italic>AMOT</italic> protein product, angiomotin, were inversely correlated with miR-497 expression. Knockdown of the <italic>AMOT</italic> gene inhibited MG-63 cell proliferation and migration, but it did not affect cell apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-497 significantly decreased the expression of angiomotin by binding the complementary sites of the <italic>AMOT</italic> gene <italic>3</italic>&#x02032;-<italic>UTR</italic>. Angiomotin, the protein product of <italic>AMOT</italic>, is a membrane-associated protein that binds to the endothelial cell surface of angiogenic cells that are involved in controlling cell migration.<xref rid="b32-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A previous study has shown that <italic>AMOT</italic> can activate ERK1/2 protein kinase pathway through regulating Rac1 GTPase directly, which enhances cell migration and stabilizes angiogenic blood vessels.<xref rid="b33-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Furthermore, <italic>AMOT</italic> has been reported to be overexpressed in human cancers and to play an important role in inhibiting the growth of tumors and altering tumor vessel permeability.<xref rid="b24-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These previously published findings are consistent with the findings of the present study that overexpression of miR-497 suppresses the proliferation and migration of human osteosarcoma cells.</p><p>In this study, there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of <italic>AMOT</italic> following miR-497 mimics transfection (data not shown), suggesting that miR-497 may regulate <italic>AMOT</italic> expression and prevent mRNA from being translated. It is clear that further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the <italic>AMOT</italic> gene by miR-497. This study was limited as it included a relatively small number of osteosarcoma tumor samples from a single center and as only a limited number of cell lines were studied. However, the method of studying human tumor samples with normal tissues and tumor cell lines with normal cell lines is, we believe, a valuable approach to understanding human tumor biology and is also a method that can be developed.<xref rid="b31-ott-9-303" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In future studies, the role of miR-497 could be investigated by using osteosarcoma tissue taken from invasive tumor foci or metastatic deposits and comparing expression levels with those in the primary tumor. In addition, the preliminary in vitro studies reported here could be extended to include other human osteosarcoma cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These preliminary studies support a role for miR-497 as a suppressor of <italic>AMOT</italic> gene expression in human osteosarcoma cells, resulting in suppression of tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Further studies are recommended to investigate the role of miR-497 in osteosarcoma and other malignant mesenchymal tumors.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The
