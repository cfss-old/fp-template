However, the role of proximity to the interface of isolated NPs has never been directly observed nor fully understood. Here we show that a reversible local switching in tunnel conductivity can be achieved by applying an appropriate voltage pulse using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope on NPs embedded in a TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. The resistive switching occurs in the TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix in correlation to the NPs that are in proximity of the surface and it is spatially confined to the single NP size. The tunnel conductivity is increased by more than one order of magnitude. The results are rationalized by a model that include the charge of NPs that work as a nano floating gate inducing local band bending that facilitates charge tunnelling and by the formation and redistribution of oxygen vacancies that concentrate in proximity of the charged NPs. Our study demonstrates the switching in tunnel conductivity in single NP and provides useful information for the understanding mechanism or resistive switching.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In the last decade existing CMOS technology has approached its physical limits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> resulting in a great deal of research toward novel devices and concepts. Non-volatile flash memories are one of the pivotal needs for knowledge&#x02013;based development and a prime challenge for science and technology. Technology demands nanometric size (viz. high density), high speed, low power consumption, high retention time, chemical and thermal stability in memory elements whose nanofabrication technology must also be compatible with the present processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Flash memory devices based on floating gate memories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and memristors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> are recognised as the most likely candidates for the post-CMOS technology in nanoscale memory-bit cells and computation devices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Both systems are quickly approaching the stage of industrial application; however, some important problems remain unsolved such as the limits of spatial resolution, where the switching occurs and the implication of the single NP at the interfaces.</p><p>Flash memory devices are based on single transistors with a floating gate. This consists of a conductive structure embedded in an insulating matrix that acts as a charge storage layer (floating gate electrode). The charge of the floating gate shifts the threshold voltage of the transistor, which can be set in a programmed state or in an erased state depending on the charging of the floating gate. The use of nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> (NPs) or nanocrystals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> as novel architectures, named nano-floating gate memories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, are of enormous interest due to advantages in tunability of charge trapping sites, which can be controlled by the size and nature of the NPs. Furthermore, the ability to process them at room temperature using simple wet processes, their compatibility with flexible substrates and eventually the ease of integration with the current technology make them ideal candidates for new flash memory devices compatible with plastic electronics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Embedded NPs also have been proven to be very important in reversible resistive switching, whose corresponding devices, called memristors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, have received an enormous amount of interest in recent years, because of their versatility and simple architecture. In the basic configuration a memristor consists of an insulating/semiconducting thin film sandwiched between two electrodes, forming a Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) device. The resistive switching occurs after the application of a high electric field/high current pulse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. It has been proven that NPs greatly improve key parameters of memristors such as stability, on/off ratio, switching speed and in reduction of the current level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>In this context, the investigation of the NPs in close proximity to the surface using scanning probe microscopy offers a unique opportunity to gain new information in the system, including, the possibility to reach the limit of spatial resolution and the possibility to investigate the sample interface after switching. Resistive switching by scanning probe microscopy has been proven at the sub-micrometric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and nanometric scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> in several systems but the role of single NP at interfaces has never been directly observed.</p><p>Here we show that a local reversible switching in tunnel conductivity can be performed at the level of a single NP by applying a voltage pulse using a scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tip on single NPs embedded in a TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. The switching in tunnel conductivity occurs in the TiO<sub>2</sub> around the NP in proximity of the surface due to NP charge trapping and is spatially confined by the NP size. We performed our experiments at room temperature using prototypical materials which are commercially available and whose processing is well established. In particular we used TiO<sub>2</sub> because it can be a good matrix in named nano-floating gate memories due to its high band-gap (~3.2&#x02005;eV) and it is largely studied in memristors. Furthermore, the protocol for thin film preparation is very simple and largely reported in literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Cobalt NPs are commercially available by the major chemical suppliers or can be easily synthetized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. They consist of a Co spheres with a diameter range between 50 and 100&#x02005;nm, covered by a thin layer of cobalt oxide and the surfactant, which allows for solubilisation in water. We used NPs with a diameter &#x0003e;50&#x02005;nm in order to demonstrate that although the STM junction occurs in a few Angstroms, the resistive switching involves and is limited to the whole NP region.</p><p>Samples were characterized by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and by scanning kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thin films 120 &#x000b1; 15&#x02005;nm thick of Co NPs embedded in TiO<sub>2</sub> were obtained by spin coating a water solution of Bis(ammonium lactate)titanium dihydroxide and of cobalt NPs on a Au substrate, the film was then calcined at high temperature (see detail in methods). As a blank, a thin film of pure TiO<sub>2</sub> was prepared following the same procedure.</p><p>Besides the occasional formation of large aggregates of NPs, AFM confirms the presence of Co NPs at the solid/air (vacuum) interface. The TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix appears to be formed by a homogeneous distribution of clusters whose mean diameter is &#x0003c;15&#x02005;nm with an r.m.s. roughness of about 1&#x02005;nm. NPs appear as randomly distributed larger clusters whose size range from 50 to 100&#x02005;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) with a density at the surface ranging from &#x0003c;1 to 10&#x02005;NPs &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>. NPs can be fully embedded in the matrix appearing as larger clusters, or partially embedded, appearing as outgrowths a few nm thick. The evidence that the outgrowths and larger clusters are not formed by different aggregations of TiO<sub>2</sub> is established by SKPM that shows an evident contrast between aggregations of TiO<sub>2</sub> and NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). NPs exhibit a typical metallic behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Outgrowths were rarely observed in blank samples nor do they show contrast at SKPM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows a typical morphology of NPs embedded in the matrix and the corresponding surface potential maps.</p><p>The electronic structure of the samples were characterized by STM/STS, which features sensitivity to the local electronic structure. In particular we used current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS), in which the tip is scanned in the constant current mode to maintain a constant distance to the sample. At each point the feedback loop is disabled and a defined number of I/V curve are recorded.</p><p>Since the NPs can locally affect the film morphology, NPs used for our experiment were selected making a large scale image at the maximum scan range of the piezo system of STM (3 &#x000d7; 3&#x02005;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in our set-up) selecting only the well-embedded NPs (e.g. NPs that emerge from the surface &#x0003c;10&#x02005;nm).</p><p>Although, occasionally, some outgrowths exhibit a higher Tunnel Conductivity (TC) than the matrix, most likely due to the local formation of defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> or to two-dimensional phases with reduced bandgap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; the CITS map appear generally homogeneous with a TC of about 10&#x02005;pA/V recorded at &#x02212;1&#x02005;V bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is almost equal to the TC of the blank samples.</p><p>The TC can be locally switched in correlation to the particular NPs by applying an appropriate voltage pulse (tip conditioning). When a positive pulse, higher than +5&#x02005;V and longer than 10&#x02005;ms, was applied in correspondence to the NP (Note: these parameters depend on the current of the set-point used before the pulse), we observed a dramatic change of TC that switches in a conductive state more than one order of magnitude higher than the matrix (HCS). The effect is not observed applying pulses in between the NPs and in blank samples. When applying pulses shorter than 100&#x02005;ms the morphology remains unaltered, on the other hand, upon applying a longer and/or higher bias we observed a progressive damaging of the surface associated to the increase of TC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the effect of conditioning on isolated NPs after applying a pulse of +5&#x02005;V for 50&#x02005;ms.</p><p>It must be noted that while the STM junction occurs in a few Angstroms (&#x0226a; than 1 pixel in the TC map), the resistive switching involves and is limited to the whole NP region. The change of TC is reversible upon applying a negative pulse bias. However, while switching a NP to HCS can be easily performed by a single pulse, the inverse process is more difficult and several scans or pulses at large negative bias are necessary to reset the system which shows a progressive decreasing of TC instead of a single switching event. We were not able to switch the system in high HCS by applying negative bias. Upon increasing the time of conditioning up to 300&#x02005;ms the surface of blank TiO<sub>2</sub> can also be modified. In this last case both positive and negative bias have the same effect producing a moderate increase of the TC. In this last case the conditioning dramatically damages the surface in an area of a few hundred nanometers and it is not reversible. We propose that in this case the electric field and current density are high enough to cause a thermal recrystallization forming the so called filaments. This phenomenon is well known and it is believed to be responsible for the so called &#x0201c;forming&#x0201d; step in conventional memristor based on TiO<sub>2</sub> in MIM structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>A detailed study of the I-V curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), helps us to identify the nature the resistive switching on single NP. The I-V curves recorded in a clean sample, before the resistive switching, show the normal behaviour of freshly prepared TiO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, both in the matrix and in relation to the NPs (Blue curve). The typical trend of a n-type semiconductor with an asymmetric band-gap of ~3.2&#x02005;eV is expressed by the zero conductance region around 0&#x02005;V bias (Curve bleu in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">fig. 3</xref>). This behaviour indicates that a thin layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> also covers the partially embedded NPs. Very rarly, exposed NPs exhibiting metallic behaviour in I-V curves were observed by STM, we excluded these zones from our experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows the I-V curves recorded corresponding to the NP during the application of +5&#x02005;V pulse bias for 50&#x02005;ms and the corresponding dI/dV curve.</p><p>Since the pulse bias does not alter the matrix, the I-V curves observed before the resistive switching are the typical curves of TiO<sub>2</sub>. After resistive switching, the curves recorded in correspondence to the NPs narrows the zero conduction region from ~3.2 to ~2&#x02005;eV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Noticeably this reduction occurs only in the negative branch of the curve (i.e. when the electrons move from the tip to the surface) while the positive branch remains almost unaltered. This indicates that some empty surface states are formed in the zone corresponding the NPs, with energy ~1&#x02005;eV below the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The I-V curve comes back in the original state as the transition is reset by applying negative pulses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>About the resistive switching that occurs only in correspondence to the NPs we speculate on the contribution of two effects:<list id="l1" list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>The charge injection inside a NP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, which occurs at a high bias by direct tunnelling in the NP. This is confirmed by the TC changes upon conditioning over the entire NP region, not only under the tip during the switching pulse. The switching in TC is not observed in blank samples, unless the dramatic damage of the surface (TiO<sub>2</sub> recrystallization). As observed in previous literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, the positive pulse injects holes into the NP, which become positively charged. The charged NPs in proximity of the surface, work as a floating gate, inducing a band bending towards a lower energy state due to the electrons in the TiO<sub>2</sub> being attracted by the charged NPs. These states are present in the thin layer in between the STM tip and the surface become accessible as empty states for tunnelling from the STM tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) at energy below the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The injection of electrons in a positively charged NP discharges the NP, thereby resetting the system. </p></list-item><list-item><p>A further contribution to resistive switching can be provided by the formation and redistribution of oxygen vacancies that are intrinsically present TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. By applying pulse bias, the oxygen vacancies form and move toward tip/TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP interface forming undefined TiOx chemical species, which in turn may create interface state and/or reduce barrier height. Such a reduced barrier effect is well known in Pt/TiO2/Pt memristor system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, NPs may enhance the effect as recently observed for ruthenium nano-dots embedded in TiO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows a scheme of the proposed switching mechanisms in TC. </p></list-item></list></p><p>For both models the possible origin of the asymmetry in the switching behaviour (i.e. the fact that the switching only occurs by injecting holes but does not work when injecting electrons) can be attributed to the redox states in the NPs related to the oxidation of some Co atoms, which form Co ions positively charged, as previously observed in Co NPs deposited on graphite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The injection of electrons should include an improbable chemical reduction of Co atoms.</p><p>In summary, we used STM to study the effect of NPs embedded in a TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix on the switching of tunnel conductivity. We have shown how resistive switching occurs in the surface state of the thin layer of TiO<sub>2</sub>, in proximity of the NPs and is spatially confined in the region between the NPs and the surface. The formation of empty surface states locally enhances the tunnel conductivity reducing the apparent band-gap of the TiO<sub>2</sub>. Using STM we measured the NPs on the surface, however we expect that the similar mechanism of TC switching occurs also inside the matrix, in this case the process involve two NPs instead a NPs and the STM tip. Here we proposed two possible contributions to TC switching, however we do not exclude that other effects could contribute to the observed switching. In forthcoming work, details of TC switching mechanism will be further investigated. In addition, the size of NPs can be significantly reduced to a few nanometres. This ongoing work will lead a better understanding of the role of NPs in resistive switching and leads to new possibilities for NP integration in nano floating gate memories and other electronic devices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Thin films</title><p>Pieces 11 &#x000d7; 11&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup> borosilicate glass covered by Cr (2.5&#x02005;nm) and Au (250&#x02005;nm) were used as substrates.
