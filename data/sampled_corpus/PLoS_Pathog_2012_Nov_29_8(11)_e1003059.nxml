There is evidence that highly pathogenic viruses encode for non-structural 1 (NS1) proteins that are more efficient in suppressing the host immune response. The NS1 protein inhibits type-I interferon (IFN) production partly by blocking the TRIM25 ubiquitin E3 ligase-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I, required for its optimal downstream signaling. In order to understand possible mechanisms of viral adaptation and host tropism, we examined the ability of NS1 encoded by human (Cal04), avian (HK156), swine (SwTx98) and mouse-adapted (PR8) influenza viruses to interact with TRIM25 orthologues from mammalian and avian species. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays we show that human TRIM25 binds to all tested NS1 proteins, whereas the chicken TRIM25 ortholog binds preferentially to the NS1 from the avian virus. Strikingly, none of the NS1 proteins were able to bind mouse TRIM25. Since NS1 can inhibit IFN production in mouse, we tested the impact of TRIM25 and NS1 on RIG-I ubiquitination in mouse cells. While NS1 efficiently suppressed human TRIM25-dependent ubiquitination of RIG-I 2CARD, NS1 inhibited the ubiquitination of full-length mouse RIG-I in a mouse TRIM25-independent manner. Therefore, we tested if the ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet, which has also been shown to ubiquitinate RIG-I, interacts with NS1. We found that NS1 binds mouse Riplet and inhibits its activity to induce IFN-&#x003b2; in murine cells. Furthermore, NS1 proteins of human but not swine or avian viruses were able to interact with human Riplet, thereby suppressing RIG-I ubiquitination. In conclusion, our results indicate that influenza NS1 protein targets TRIM25 and Riplet ubiquitin E3 ligases in a species-specific manner for the inhibition of RIG-I ubiquitination and antiviral IFN production.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasionally, major global pandemics. To establish productive infection these viruses have mechanisms to evade host immune responses, including the type-I interferon (IFN) response. An important component of the IFN system is the helicase RIG-I that recognizes viral RNA, and is subsequently ubiquitinated by TRIM25 ubiquitin E3 ligase to induce downstream signaling resulting in IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production. The NS1 protein of influenza A viruses binds to human TRIM25 and inhibits TRIM25-dependent RIG-I ubiquitination and downstream RIG-I signaling. An important unresolved question is how viruses can inhibit the RIG-I pathway when infecting new hosts. Here we show that while human TRIM25 is able to bind to different NS1 proteins, chicken TRIM25 binds preferentially to the NS1 from an avian virus. Strikingly, mouse TRIM25 was unable to bind NS1. We found that NS1 blocks RIG-I signaling in mouse and human cells by different mechanisms. While NS1 inhibits human TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, in mouse cells NS1 suppresses RIG-I signaling by binding to and inhibiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet. These results help understand the immune evasion strategies used by influenza virus in different species, and may partly explain the ability of this virus to adapt to different host species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by U.S. Public Health Service grants RO1 AI087846 and RR00168 (M.U.G.), RO1 AI046954, U19 AI083025 and CRIP (Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis, NIAID CEIRS contract HHSN266200700010C) (A.G.-S.).

IAVs are naturally maintained in avian species but they also circulate in humans, horses, dogs and pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Taubenberger1">[3]</xref>. Although multigenic host range restrictions exist, a combination of viral determinants can ultimately allow a virus to establish infection in a specific host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Basler1">[4]</xref>. This is particularly important because, although the current highly pathogenic avian IAVs that have been transmitted to humans lack the ability to spread from human to human, there is current concern that these avian viruses may adapt and develop the ability to spread efficiently among humans. In this respect, recent studies have demonstrated that only a few mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) allow for transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in ferrets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Herfst1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Imai1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, pigs can be infected with human and avian viruses and provide an environment for reassortment and the generation of new influenza virus strains capable of human transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Brown1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to better understand the mechanisms that allow influenza viruses to adapt to a new host species, in order to predict and protect from future cross-species transmission.</p><p>IAV is an enveloped virus that harbors a negative-strand RNA genome encoding eleven different proteins from 8 separate segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Palese1">[8]</xref>. Individual viral proteins play critical roles in species-specific pathogenicity. For example, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein which binds in a species-dependent manner to sialic acid on host cell membranes; the neuraminidase (NA) protein which is important for viral release; and the polymerase components (PA, PB1, PB2) which are important for efficient replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Medina1">[9]</xref>. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which is the product of the smallest RNA segment, acts as a virulence factor by inhibiting host immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Donelan1">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Krug1">[15]</xref>. An important host innate immune mechanism is the production of type-I interferons (IFNs), which can establish an antiviral state by up-regulating interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that interfere with distinct steps in the viral life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-GarciaSastre1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Schoggins1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Type-I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced when host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as nucleic acids or other structural components of the microbe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Akira1">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Meylan1">[21]</xref>. Viral single-stranded or short double-stranded RNA bearing a 5&#x02032;-triphosphate is recognized by the cytosolic RNA helicase RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Hornung1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Pichlmair1">[23]</xref>. In addition, next-generation RNA sequencing revealed that in influenza A virus infected cells RIG-I preferentially associated with the shorter genomic segments as well as subgenomic defective interfering particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Baum1">[24]</xref>. RIG-I is composed of two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H box helicase/ATPase, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD/RD). Under normal conditions, RIG-I is in an inactive, closed conformation. Upon RNA recognition, exposure of the N-terminal CARDs of human RIG-I leads to Lys63-linked ubiquitination on Lys172 induced by tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) ubiquitin E3 ligase. The ubiquitinated CARDs then allow RIG-I binding to MAVS (also called IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA) and thereby downstream signaling for IRF3 phosphorylation and type-I IFN production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1">[25]</xref>. Another ubiquitin E3 ligase, Riplet (or RNF135), has also been reported to ubiquitinate RIG-I and promote its signal transducing ability for antiviral IFN production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi2">[27]</xref>. Specifically, Riplet was shown to activate RIG-I by inducing Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the lysine residues 849 and 851 in the RIG-I CTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi2">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Many viruses are equipped with specialized mechanisms to suppress the host type-I IFN system.

The importance of this mechanism of antagonism is further supported by the fact that some highly pathogenic viruses encode NS1 proteins that are more efficient in suppressing the host antiviral response. For example, the NS1 protein of the highly pathogenic 1918 virus blocked the expression of IFN-regulated genes more efficiently than the NS1 from influenza A/WSN/33 virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Geiss1">[11]</xref>. In addition, the NS1 gene of a human IAV, when passaged in mouse, accumulated adaptive mutations that resulted in increased virulence and IFN antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Forbes1">[34]</xref>. Importantly, in addition to NS1, also other viral genes, including PA, PB1, PB2 and PB1-F2 have been shown to exert IFN-antagonistic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Graef1">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Varga1">[37]</xref>.</p><p>We have recently uncovered the mechanism of RIG-I inhibition by NS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2">[38]</xref>. NS1 binds to the central coiled-coil (CCD) region of TRIM25 ubiquitin E3 ligase, blocking its oligomerization and enzymatic activity to induce Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs. NS1 thereby inhibits RIG-I CARD-dependent downstream signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2">[38]</xref>. However there are differences in PRR signaling components of different species that could impact NS1 immunosuppressive function. For example, mouse RIG-I lacks Lys172, which has been previously shown to be essential for ubiquitination-dependent activation of human RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1">[25]</xref>. In addition, it appears that chicken lacks a functional RIG-I gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1">[39]</xref>. This host specificity in the RIG-I antiviral signaling pathway may provide a barrier for new incoming viruses, which in turn will need to adapt to inhibit these host-specific immune responses.</p><p>In this study, we examined the ability of NS1 encoded by human (Cal04), avian (HK156), swine (SwTx98), and mouse (PR8) adapted influenza A viruses to interact with TRIM25 orthologues from mammalian and avian species, and the impact that this interaction has in regulating the RIG-I-mediated type-I IFN response. We found that while NS1 efficiently inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation in human cells, in murine cells NS1 targets the ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet to suppress RIG-I ubiquitination and signal transducing activity.

Empty vector and V5-tagged human TRIM21 were used as negative controls. Whole-cell lysates (WCLs) of HEK293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-V5 antibody, followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-NS1.

We thus asked whether chTRIM25 is important for IFN-&#x003b2; induction upon IAV infection, and further tested if the chTRIM25-NS1 interaction is functional. To this end, we silenced endogenous TRIM25 in chicken LMH cells and measured IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA expression upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figures 1B&#x02013;1D</xref>). Specifically, we used recombinant A/PR/8/34 viruses expressing NS1 proteins from PR8, SwTx98, and HK156, which showed differential binding to chTRIM25, as well as a PR8 recombinant virus expressing the NS1 mutant R38A/K41A, known to be deficient in IFN antagonism due to its abolished dsRNA and hTRIM25 binding ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Donelan1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Talon1">[41]</xref>. Approximately 87% knockdown of chTRIM25 mRNA levels was achieved as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to mock-infected control cells, IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA was highly up-regulated (&#x0223c;1500-fold) upon infection with the NS1 mutant R38A/K41A virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This IFN-&#x003b2; induction was significantly reduced in TRIM25-knockdown LMH cells, suggesting that TRIM25 is indeed functional in chicken cells. In addition, IFN-&#x003b2; induction upon infection with PR8, SwTx98 and HK156 recombinant viruses inversely correlated with the ability of their NS1 proteins to bind chTRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). While PR8 and HK156 were poor inducers of IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA, infection with SwTx98 virus, whose NS1 protein did not bind chTRIM25, resulted in &#x0223c;15-fold IFN-&#x003b2; induction. Furthermore, the IFN-&#x003b2; induction by SwTx98 virus was reduced to almost basal levels in TRIM25-knockdown cells, indicating that this virus induces IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression in chicken cells by a mechanism mostly dependent on TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To exclude that the low levels of IFN production induced by the PR8 and HK156 viruses are due to inefficient replication in LMH cells, we measured the mRNA levels of viral M1 by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). All viruses replicated well, and although only minor differences were observed, the levels of M1 mRNA inversely correlated with the IFN-&#x003b2; inducing activity of these viruses.

For this, we infected murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with the different NS1 recombinant viruses. IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA induction was then determined by qPCR, and IFN protein levels were measured by bioassay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1F, left panel</xref>s).

Binding of NS1 to CPSF30 could also not account for this inhibitory activity in MEFs, as all of these NS1 proteins are deficient in inhibiting CPSF30 and thus general gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Hale2">[40]</xref>.

It is therefore important to understand the detailed mechanisms by which influenza virus escapes the immune response in this particular host. Thus, we first sought to confirm the lack of NS1 interaction with mTRIM25. To rule out that the inability of NS1 to bind to mTRIM25 was due to the absence of a co-factor required for NS1-TRIM25-interaction in human cells, we tested the binding of NS1-PR8 to endogenous TRIM25 in PR8-infected human HEK293T and murine Hepa1.6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

For this, we examined the ubiquitination of RIG-I in Hepa1.6 cells in which endogenous Riplet was silenced using specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). 78% knockdown efficiency was achieved as determined by RT-PCR analysis compared to non-silencing control siRNA (data not shown). Specific knockdown of endogenous Riplet strongly decreased endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, co-expressed NS1 efficiently blocked the ubiquitination of RIG-I in cells transfected with non-silencing control siRNA, while NS1 had no effect on the residual ubiquitination of RIG-I observed in Riplet-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

Therefore, we tested if human Riplet interacts with the different NS1 proteins in the context of viral infection. Interestingly, the NS1 from human influenza viruses (Tx91 and Pan99) interacted with human Riplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), suggesting that the capacity of NS1 binding to mouse Riplet might reflect an interaction of NS1 with Riplet derived from its specific host. To further demonstrate that the interaction of NS1 with human Riplet is biologically relevant, we compared the capacity of Tx91-NS1 and PR8-NS1 recombinant viruses to inhibit the ubiquitination of human RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). We reasoned that Tx91-NS1 that binds both hTRIM25 and hRiplet, should be more efficient in inhibiting RIG-I ubiquitination (and IFN induction) than PR8-NS1 shown to bind only hTRIM25. As predicted, Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus was more efficient in inhibiting human RIG-I ubiquitination as compared to PR8-NS1 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Accordingly, Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus induced significantly lower levels of IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA as compared to PR8 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, we analyzed IFN-&#x003b2; production in PR8- and Tx91-infected A549 cells upon knockdown of TRIM25, Riplet or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figures 8D and 8E</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced TRIM25 and Riplet mRNA levels by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. Furthermore, the knockdown was highly specific, as targeting TRIM25 did not reduce Riplet mRNA levels and <italic>vice-versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Silencing of endogenous TRIM25 in PR8-infected cells resulted in a slight but not significant decrease of IFN-&#x003b2; induction as compared to cells transfected with non-silencing control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). In contrast, IFN induction by PR8 was significantly reduced in Riplet-knockdown cells as compared to controls, and almost to the same extent as the levels induced by the Tx91 virus in control cells. These results suggest that while PR8 inhibits IFN induction by targeting TRIM25, the residual IFN induction (not inhibited by the virus) depends mostly on Riplet. Conversely, knockdown of either TRIM25 or Riplet did not have a significant effect on IFN induction in Tx91-infected cells. A significant reduction in IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA levels was only observed in cells in which both TRIM25 and Riplet were silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that both TRIM25 and Riplet are important for IFN-&#x003b2; production in human cells upon influenza virus infection.

We demonstrated that NS1 proteins from avian and mammalian isolates are capable of binding to human, but not mouse TRIM25. In mouse cells, NS1 protein inhibits RIG-I ubiquitination and downstream IFN promoter activation primarily by a mechanism that involves binding to and inhibiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet. This mechanism thus clearly differs from the previously described mechanism for NS1 antagonism of TRIM25 in human cells. As mice are not natural hosts of influenza virus infection, we reasoned that the ability of influenza virus NS1 to inhibit mouse Riplet most likely reflects its inherent ability to inhibit Riplet from other animal species. Indeed, our study showed that the NS1 protein of human viruses efficiently bound and suppressed human Riplet, indicating that specifically human viruses have evolved to inhibit both TRIM25 and Riplet for the suppression of RIG-I antiviral activity in human cells. Interestingly, Riplet is highly similar to TRIM25 sharing 60.8% sequence homology. Like TRIM25, Riplet contains an N-terminal RING domain and a C-terminal SPRY domain. However, in contrast to TRIM25, Riplet does not contain a B-box domain and thus it does not belong to the TRIM protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi1">[26]</xref>. Importantly, bioinformatic analysis also predicted the presence of a central CCD in Riplet, with structural similarities to the TRIM25 CCD (data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the precise binding site of NS1 in Riplet, and whether this interaction requires the Riplet CCD.</p><fig id="ppat-1003059-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003059.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Proposed model of the species-specific inhibition of RIG-I by influenza A virus NS1 protein.</title><p>The NS1 proteins of avian influenza viruses bind to chicken TRIM25, thereby suppressing IFN induction.

Although RIG-I has been reported to be absent in chicken cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1">[39]</xref>, the fact that avian NS1 efficiently interacted with chicken TRIM25 and that the HK156 virus was a poor inducer of IFN in chicken cells, suggests that this interaction is likely to be functional. In addition, we observed higher levels of IFN induction in chicken cells by SwTx98 recombinant virus correlating with the inability of its NS1 protein to bind chicken TRIM25. Knockdown of TRIM25 in chicken cells resulted in reduced IFN-&#x003b2; induction in infected cells, further evidencing that TRIM25 is active and that NS1 targets its function in chicken cells. Importantly, there are no Riplet sequences reported for the chicken or duck genomes, suggesting that influenza A viruses that are maintained in avian species have adapted to coexist with their host by targeting TRIM25, but not Riplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Further studies will be required to elucidate the target of TRIM25 in chicken, and whether the same principles apply to the natural avian reservoir of influenza viruses, migratory ducks, which are known to have RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1">[39]</xref>.</p><p>By studying RIG-I ubiquitination and signal-transducing activity in murine cells, we have also uncovered commonalities and differences between human and mouse RIG-I regulation. Although Lys172, the critical residue for RIG-I ubiquitination in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1">[25]</xref>, is not conserved in mouse, we observed a robust ubiquitination of mouse RIG-I 2CARD, suggesting that other lysine residues in the mouse RIG-I CARDs are ubiquitinated. Furthermore, our studies using <italic>TRIM25 &#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells indicate that the ubiquitination of mouse RIG-I 2CARD, in contrast to that of human RIG-I 2CARD, is less affected in the absence of TRIM25, indicating that in addition to TRIM25 another ubiquitin E3 ligase mediates RIG-I 2CARD ubiquitination in mouse. The ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet has been reported to ubiquitinate RIG-I, thereby leading to its optimal activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Oshiumi2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gao1">[43]</xref>.

Our data suggests that, at least in the mouse system, Riplet is unlikely to ubiquitinate the 2CARD, because NS1 was unable to inhibit mouse RIG-I 2CARD ubiquitination. Therefore, in addition to TRIM25 there may be an additional ubiquitin E3 ligase in mice that ubiquitinates the RIG-I N-terminal CARDs, and this E3 ligase is most likely not targeted by NS1. Nevertheless, our studies clearly showed that Riplet plays a crucial role for RIG-I ubiquitination-dependent activation in mouse, most likely by ubiquitinating the C-terminal region of RIG-I. Additional work will be needed to further define the roles and contributions of these ubiquitin E3 ligases for RIG-I activation in mouse.</p><p>For our interaction studies, we used NS1 proteins of influenza viruses that are not able to bind CPSF30. This facilitates the interpretation of the results, as their expression is not associated with inhibition of general host protein expression. However, we have also shown that the NS1 proteins of the Tx91 and Pan99 strains, which were previously shown to interact with CPSF30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Hale2">[40]</xref>, are also able to interact with human and mouse Riplet in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g006">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">8A</xref>).

Alternatively, the interaction between NS1 and mouse Riplet could be mediated by viral RNA.</p><p>In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2">[38]</xref>, we also showed that the PR8 recombinant virus carrying the E96A/E97A NS1 mutant was able to induce IFN in WT and <italic>TRIM25 +/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs, but it lost this IFN-inducing capacity in <italic>TRIM25 &#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells.

Our experiments in <italic>TRIM25 &#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells showed that whereas human RIG-I 2CARD ubiquitination is undetectable in <italic>TRIM25 &#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, mouse RIG-I 2CARD showed residual ubiquitination under these conditions. In addition, knockdown of endogenous Riplet in mouse cells strongly decreased RIG-I full-length ubiquitination. Taken together, this suggests that while TRIM25 is the primary E3 ligase for human RIG-I ubiquitination, in mouse other ubiquitin E3 ligases including Riplet may play a crucial role for RIG-I ubiquitination-dependent activation. Under this scenario, in mouse cells NS1 must target Riplet for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The mechanistic differences by how influenza virus NS1 inhibits the RIG-I pathway in human and mouse cells indicate that caution should be used to appropriately interpret future experiments on host responses during influenza virus infection using the mouse model.</p><p>Our study also identified two NS1 proteins from human viruses (Tx91 and Pan99) which efficiently bound to human Riplet. Furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing the Tx91 NS1 protein was more efficient in inhibiting endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination and IFN induction in human cells as compared to PR8 WT virus, whose NS1 protein does not bind human Riplet. These results are in agreement with the high capacity of Tx91 virus to inhibit the antiviral state in human dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003059-Haye1">[44]</xref>. Combined with our knockdown analyses in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figures 8D and 8E</xref>), this suggests that human viruses such as Tx91 have evolved to interact with both TRIM25 and Riplet in human cells for the comprehensive inhibition of the RIG-I-induced IFN response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Finally, although we have used representative strains from different hosts, we cannot exclude that not all strains from a specific host have the observed specificity of antagonism. Future studies are needed to test NS1 proteins of various different strains for their ability to inhibit TRIM25 and Riplet from multiple hosts, and whether this correlates with the ability of these viruses to suppress the IFN response in the respective host.</p><p>Taken together, our work suggests that influenza viruses can readily adapt to circumvent the type-I IFN system in different host species by targeting host-specific proteins involved in IFN induction. It stresses the importance of host-specific signaling pathways and immune responses when choosing animal models for studying influenza pathogenicity.
