Although detailed studies are lacking for most viruses, work on influenza A virus (IAV) has suggested that IFITM3, in particular, inhibits viral entry by interfering with endosomal, low pH&#x02010;induced fusion <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>.

Moreover, the SFV E1 glycoprotein undergoes a characteristic low pH&#x02010;induced conformational change with similar kinetics in both IFITM3&#x02010;expressing and non&#x02010;expressing cells.

To further test IFITM3&#x02010;mediated inhibition, we used two additional sets of A549 stable cells produced using puromycin selection.

The other set (P2) included cells expressing IFITM3&#x02010;HA, IFITM3&#x02010;HA with a Y20A mutation and a GFP control. The Y20A mutation disrupts a Yxx&#x003d5; type endocytosis signal in the IFITM3 N&#x02010;terminal domain (NTD), causing accumulation of the protein at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="tra12416-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, Figures S1 and <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B).

A) Western blotting was used to analyze the IFITM expression of all three sets of cells (OS = the original single cell clones used in Figure <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A, 1, 2 and 3 denote A549, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, respectively. Antibodies against the IFITM1&#x02010;NTD (which cross&#x02010;react with IFITM3) or IFITM3&#x02010;NTD (which cross&#x02010;react with IFITM2) were used to analyze IFITM expression. Tubulin was used as a loading control. Fluorescence intensity (int.) of the IFITM and tubulin bands was quantified using LiCOR Odyssey software. IFITM band intensities were normalized to tubulin loading and arbitrarily set relative to the highest band intensity on each blot (OS&#x02010;IFITM3&#x02010;HA in both cases).

OS&#x02010;IFITM2&#x02010;HA and IFITM3&#x02010;HA cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained using an anti&#x02010;IFITM3&#x02010;NTD antibody, and markers of early and late endosomes and lysosomes. A) Example images of cells co&#x02010;stained for IFITM and transferrin receptor (TfR) and visualized with AF488 (IFITM &#x02013; green) and AF647 (TfR &#x02013; magenta) by confocal microscopy.

Data are from three independent experiments using between 18 and 21 fields of view collected using a 63&#x000d7; objective lens. Quantification of overlapping pixels and significance testing is described in <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context">Materials and Methods</styled-content>.

After appropriate treatments, cells were lysed and the lysates treated with trypsin, or not, and the viral E1/E2 proteins analyzed by western blot. Samples were not heated prior to SDS&#x02010;PAGE as this can dissociate the E1 HT.

It appeared that the three A549 cells had different permissiveness to infection by plasma membrane fusion. The parental OS&#x02010;A549 cells were the least permissive to plasma membrane fusion; the P1&#x02010;A549 cells (stably transfected with an empty puromycin resistance vector) were the most permissive, while the P2&#x02010;A549 cells (stably transfected with a GFP construct) were in the middle. We speculate that the different manipulations of these cells may be responsible for the variability.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="tra12416-fig-0008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>

A) OS&#x02010;, P1&#x02010; and P2&#x02010;IFITM&#x02010;HA cells were infected by SFV through plasma membrane fusion. Cells were pre&#x02010;treated with either DMSO or bafilomycin A1 (Baf A) prior to addition of SFV (5 pfu/cell) for surface binding at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h (in the presence of DMSO or Baf A). Surface&#x02010;bound virions were then allowed to enter cells by endocytosis (pH 6.8) or fused directly at the cell surface (pH 5.5). pH 6.8 media containing DMSO or Baf A (matched to the pre&#x02010;treatment) was then added to the cells, which were incubated for 5.5&#x02013;6 h at 37&#x000b0;C to allow infection. As a control for the Baf A pre&#x02010;treatment, cells were instead pre&#x02010;treated with DMSO, then incubated with Baf A containing media for the infection period (pH 5.5 D/B). Cells were fixed and infection determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Baf A inhibited infection through the endocytic route (black bars compared to white bars). Low pH treatment resulted in bypass of Baf A inhibition, indicative of cell surface fusion (green and magenta bars). The bars indicate the mean infection percentages from three independent experiments (each containing triplicates for each sample) with standard deviation shown as the error bars. Statistical significance was determined using normalized infection values, comparing pH 5.5 DMSO/Baf A (green) or pH 5.5 Baf A (magenta) of A549 samples with IFITM samples, as detailed in the <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context">Materials and Methods</styled-content> section. *p &#x0003c; 0.05, **p &#x0003c; 0.01, ***p &#x0003c; 0.001, ****p &#x0003c; 0.0001.

However, to date there is little evidence that IFITMs restrict alphavirus infection. Here we show that IFITM3, and to a lesser extent IFITM2, can inhibit the replication of two alphaviruses in A549 cells. Using SFV, we show that virus binding, endocytosis, delivery to endosomes and exposure to acidic pH are unaffected by IFITM3 expression. The viral envelope proteins undergo an acid&#x02010;dependent conformational change with similar kinetics in IFITM3 expressing and non&#x02010;expressing cells. However, the viral capsid protein does not appear in the cytosol of IFITM3 expressing cells. These results indicate that IFITM3 restricts SFV infection by inhibiting endosomal fusion and/or uncoating of the viral capsid.</p><p id="tra12416-para-0037">To date the broad antiviral activity of IFITMs has been largely seen through the use of retrovirus&#x02010;based pseudotype reporter systems <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. However, for influenza A virus (IAV) the inhibitory activity of IFITM3 has been better characterized and appears to occur following virus endocytosis and delivery to endosomes, but prior to detection of the viral RNA in the nucleus <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism(s) of IFITM3&#x02010;mediated restriction remains unclear. Based on lipid mixing assays, Desai <italic>et al.</italic> suggest that IFITM3 inhibits IAV genome release from endosomes after the formation of hemifusion intermediates <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. While Li et al. suggest that IFITM proteins inhibit the initial lipid mixing events leading to hemifusion, based on cell&#x02013;cell fusion experiments with IAV and the retrovirus JSRV <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Our experiments with SFV indicate that virus delivery to acidic endosomes and the initial steps in the fusion reaction, including low pH&#x02010;induced conformational changes in the viral envelope protein are unaffected by IFITM3. Nevertheless, delivery of the capsid to the cytosol is blocked, suggesting that IFITM3 inhibits membrane fusion or, possibly, uncoating after fusion has occurred.</p><p id="tra12416-para-0038">It is interesting to note that IFITM1 did not inhibit endocytic entry of either alphavirus since many other viruses show at least some sensitivity to this protein <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. Furthermore, dengue virus, a type II fusion protein expressing virus, similar to alphaviruses, is restricted by IFITM1, 2 and 3 <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. We speculate endocytic uptake and fusion with early endosomes allows SFV to escape inhibition from the plasma membrane localized IFITM1, in this system. However, why the endocytic route of alphavirus entry is not inhibited by IFITM1, while other endocytosed, low pH&#x02010;dependent viruses (such as dengue) are inhibited, remains unclear.</p><p id="tra12416-para-0039">Previously the effect of IFITM protein expression on SFV E1/E2&#x02010;mediated fusion from within (cell&#x02013;cell fusion facilitated by E1/E2 expressed on the cell surface and exposure of cells to low pH medium) was reported <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. In that study IFITM1 and IFITM3 were found to inhibit syncytium formation. In agreement, we also see that both IFITM1 and IFITM3 can inhibit infection by SFV, when virus is fused at the cell surface. Immunofluorescence (Figure <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>), EM (data not shown) and flow cytometry (Figure <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B) show lower levels of IFITM3 at the cell surface than IFITM1. It is therefore interesting that IFITM3 seems to be able to inhibit infection by cell surface fusion to an equivalent or greater extent than IFITM1 (Figure <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). Furthermore, when IFITM3 is relocated to the plasma membrane (IFITM3&#x02010;Y20A) greater inhibition of infection was seen compared to IFITM1 (Figure <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). We conclude that IFITM3 has greater potency for inhibiting SFV fusion than IFITM1. Understanding this difference may provide insights to the mechanism(s) underlying the ability of IFITMs to restrict viral replication.</p><p id="tra12416-para-0040">Finally, we observed that the antiviral action of IFITM3 can be saturated by increasing the amount of virus, and is also influenced by the level of IFITM protein expression (Figures <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="tra12416-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Type I interferon treatment of A549 cells results in similar levels of IFITM expression as seen in the P1 and P2 cell sets (data not shown). This ability to saturate IFITM3 restriction could be explained if there is a level of direct interaction between IFITM3 and SFV fusion sites. Whether IFITM3 is recruited to sites of membrane fusion, or is localized to specific membrane domains conducive for fusion, remains to be established.</p><p id="tra12416-para-0041">With the wealth of experimental data on SFV membrane fusion, using alphaviruses as a model may aid our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying IFITM&#x02010;mediated inhibition of viral infection. Elucidating these mechanisms may help to generate novel therapeutic strategies that could be applied against a broad range of both human and animal pathogens, and to further our understanding of membrane fusion, a phenomenon that underpins many more biological functions than viral entry.</p></sec><sec id="tra12416-sec-0012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="tra12416-sec-0013"><title>Cell lines and viruses</title><p id="tra12416-para-0042">The previously described <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> original set (designated OS) of A549 cells stably expressing C&#x02010;terminal HA&#x02010;tagged human IFITM1, 2 or 3, were cultured in Ham's F&#x02010;12 GlutaMAX media (all cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, unless otherwise stated), supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum [FCS (PAA)] and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, 10 000 units/mL, 10 000 &#x000b5;g/mL), as previously described <xref rid="tra12416-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>.

Cells were then placed on ice and washed with cold BM containing DMSO or Baf A prior to addition of 5 pfu/cell SFV to bind to the cell surface (in the presence of Baf A or DMSO). The cells were washed to remove unbound virus and treated with 37&#x000b0;C BM (containing DMSO or Baf A) adjusted to pH 5.5 for 3 min (or pH 6.8 as control), to trigger viral fusion at the cell surface. Cells were subsequently incubated for 5.5&#x02013;6 h in F&#x02010;12 infection media containing DMSO or Baf A. Control samples, pH 6.8 DMSO, were treated with F12 infection media containing DMSO, allowing viral entry through the normal endosomal route. Cells pre&#x02010;treated with Baf A and pH 6.8 media were incubated with infection media containing Baf A, allowing endocytosis but inhibiting low pH&#x02010;induced viral fusion in endosomes. Cells pre&#x02010;treated with Baf A and given a pH 5.5 pulse were incubated with infection media containing Baf A to trigger fusion at the plasma membrane, while inhibiting acidification of endosomes, such that the low pH trigger was only received at the plasma membrane. Cells pre&#x02010;treated with DMSO and given a pH 5.5 pulse were incubated with infection media containing Baf A, to again block endosomal acidification and as a control for Baf A pre&#x02010;treatment. Infected cells were detected by immunofluorescence, as described above, using antibodies against E1/E2. Three random epifluorescence images, at 20&#x000d7; magnification, were taken for each well and analyzed for infection percentage using <sc>imagej</sc> software. Briefly, nuclei were segmented to detect the total number of cells per field. The segmented nuclei were super&#x02010;imposed on the fluorescence channel marking infected cells (E1/E2 stained cells) and a ring of 10 pixels was expanded around each super&#x02010;imposed nuclei. The E1/E2 fluorescence intensity within this ring was used to score cells as infected or uninfected. The percentage of infected cells was determined for each image and used to determine the percentage of infected cells per well. All infections were carried out in triplicate wells, and the mean infection percentage calculated. In order to test statistical significance of inhibition all infection percentages were set relative to the A549 pH 6.8 DMSO condition within each cell line set (such that OS&#x02010;IFITMs were only compared to OS&#x02010;A549, for example), thus giving a measure of the relative infection percentage induced by the pH 5.5 treatments.
