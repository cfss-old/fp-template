In cultured myoblasts, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate differentiation and promote hypertrophy. IGFs also maintain muscle cell viability. We previously described C2 skeletal muscle lines lacking expression of IGF-II. These cells did not differentiate, but underwent progressive apoptotic death when incubated in differentiation medium. Viability could be sustained and differentiation enabled by IGF analogues that activated the IGF-I receptor&#x0003b; survival was dependent on stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). We now find that IGF action promotes myoblast survival through two distinguishable PI3-kinase&#x02013;regulated pathways that culminate in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. Incubation with IGF-I or transfection with active PI3-kinase led to rapid induction of MyoD and p21, and forced expression of either protein maintained viability in the absence of growth factors. Ectopic expression of MyoD induced p21, and inhibition of p21 blocked MyoD-mediated survival, thus defining one PI3-kinase&#x02013;dependent pathway as leading first to MyoD, and then to p21 and survival. Unexpectedly, loss of MyoD expression did not impede IGF-mediated survival, revealing a second pathway involving activation by PI3-kinase of Akt, and subsequent induction of p21. Since inhibition of p21 caused death even in the presence of IGF-I, these results establish a central role for p21 as a survival factor for muscle cells. Our observations also define a MyoD-independent pathway for regulating p21 in muscle, and demonstrate that distinct mechanisms help ensure appropriate expression of this key protein during differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>insulin-like growth factors</kwd><kwd>p21</kwd><kwd>MyoD</kwd><kwd>phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-I and IGF&#x02013;II, comprise with insulin a structurally related family of peptides of fundamental importance for normal somatic growth, for intermediary metabolism, and for the survival, proliferation, and terminal differentiation of many different cell types (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="JonesandClemmons1995">Jones and Clemmons 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StewartandRotwein1996a">Stewart and Rotwein 1996a</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Basergaetal1997">Baserga et al. 1997</xref>). The biological effects of these proteins are mediated by a pair of related receptors.

The signal transduction pathways and mechanisms involved in IGF-mediated muscle cell survival and differentiation have not been completely elucidated. Recent studies have indicated that two classes of intracellular signaling molecules, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and mitogen-activated protein kinases, are involved in muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kalimanetal1996">Kaliman et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kalimanetal1998">Kaliman et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BennettandTonks1997">Bennett and Tonks 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Coolicanetal1997">Coolican et al. 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sarbassovetal1997">Sarbassov et al. 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gredingeretal1998">Gredinger et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Jiangetal1998">Jiang et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SarbassovandPeterson1998">Sarbassov and Peterson 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="CuendaandCohen1999">Cuenda and Cohen 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MusaroandRosenthal1999">Musaro and Rosenthal 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rommeletal1999">Rommel et al. 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zetseretal1999">Zetser et al. 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="TamirandBengal2000">Tamir and Bengal 2000</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wuetal2000">Wu et al. 2000</xref>), with the PI3-kinase pathway being considered more critical. At present, the mechanisms have not been established by which these signaling molecules or other pathways activated by the IGF-I receptor might collaborate with myogenic regulatory factors to regulate muscle cell viability or differentiation.</p><p>The muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, MyoD, myogenin, MRF4, and Myf5, were initially identified as master regulators of cell fate because of their ability to confer a skeletal muscle phenotype on nonmuscle cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Weintraub1993">Weintraub 1993</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OlsonandKlein1994">Olson and Klein 1994</xref>). These proteins function by activating genes that are required for muscle determination and/or differentiation through the formation of heterodimers with ubiquitous bHLH proteins, and subsequent binding to specific sequences termed E boxes in the promoter-regulatory regions of muscle-restricted target genes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Weintraub1993">Weintraub 1993</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OlsonandKlein1994">Olson and Klein 1994</xref>). One of the targets of MyoD is the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, p21, also known as Waf1 and Cip1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ball1997">Ball 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="El-Deiry1998">El-Deiry 1998</xref>). This protein, and related molecules, p27/Kip1 and p57/Kip2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ball1997">Ball 1997</xref>), act to block progression through the cell cycle by reversibly inhibiting complexes of several different cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Elledge1996">Elledge 1996</xref>). In cultured muscle cells, p21 expression is induced as an early event during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Guoetal1995">Guo et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maletal2000">Mal et al. 2000</xref>). The increase in p21 is temporally associated with an ongoing decline in cyclin-dependent kinase activity as differentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Guoetal1995">Guo et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maletal2000">Mal et al. 2000</xref>), and p21 has been found to become part of a complex containing cyclin E and cdk2 in differentiating C2 muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maletal2000">Mal et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, induction of p21 has been shown to correlate with development of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WangandWalsh1996">Wang and Walsh 1996</xref>). The significance of p21 action in skeletal muscle is underscored by observations that high levels of p21 mRNA are detected in early muscle fibers in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>), and that mice deficient in both p21 and p57 have defective muscle formation and exhibit increased rates of myoblast apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1999">Zhang et al. 1999</xref>). It generally has been accepted that MyoD is a key transcription factor regulating p21 gene expression during muscle differentiation. MyoD has been found to enhance activity of the p21 promoter in transient transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>), and to stimulate p21 mRNA and protein accumulation in muscle cells and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Guoetal1995">Guo et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>), including cells lacking p53, the tumor suppressor protein that also can activate the p21 gene (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>In this manuscript, we address the question of how IGF action promotes muscle cell survival through study of C2 myoblasts and a derived cell line that lacks expression of IGF-II (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StewartandRotwein1996b">Stewart and Rotwein 1996b</xref>). These cells undergo rapid apoptotic death when incubated in low serum differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StewartandRotwein1996b">Stewart and Rotwein 1996b</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lawloretal2000">Lawlor et al. 2000</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LawlorandRotwein2000">Lawlor and Rotwein 2000</xref>). Addition of IGF-I or analogues that activate the IGF-I receptor maintain cell viability, but this is reversed by inhibitors of PI3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lawloretal2000">Lawlor et al. 2000</xref>). We now find that IGF action promotes myoblast survival by two different PI3-kinase&#x02013;dependent pathways that converge on p21. Incubation with IGF-I, or transfection with active PI3-kinase, leads to rapid induction of MyoD and p21, and ectopic expression of either protein sustains muscle cell survival in the absence of growth factors. Forced expression of MyoD induces p21, and inhibition of p21 expression blocks MyoD-mediated survival, thus defining one pathway as leading through PI3-kinase to MyoD, and then to p21 and survival. The second IGF-stimulated pathway involves activation of the serine-threonine kinase, Akt, a protein that has been shown to play a key role in the survival of many different cell types (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dattaetal1999">Datta et al. 1999</xref>). We find that Akt induces p21 in myoblasts by a mechanism that does not require MyoD. Since inhibition of p21 causes apoptotic death even in the presence of IGF-I, our results establish a central role for p21 as a survival factor for muscle cells, and demonstrate that distinct but integrated mechanisms help ensure the appropriate expression of this key protein during myogenic differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Fetal calf serum, newborn calf serum, horse serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate buffered saline, G418, PDGF-BB, and TRIzol were purchased from Life Technologies.

We thus asked whether IGF treatment stimulated expression of MyoD or p21 in C2AS12 cells. Results of time course studies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. Treatment with IGF-I caused a sustained increase in the abundance of both MyoD and p21 mRNAs beginning at 8 h, the earliest time point examined, and lasting up to 48 h. Peak values of 7- and 10-fold above baseline were seen at 24 h for MyoD and p21, respectively. By contrast, PDGF-BB had a minimal effect. Similar results were seen when MyoD and p21 protein expression was examined. A progressive increase was seen in the abundance of both proteins after incubation with IGF-I, reaching fourfold above T<sub>0</sub> for MyoD and sevenfold for p21 (mean &#x000b1; SEM of three experiments). PDGF caused at best a transient rise in MyoD that returned to baseline levels or below within 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). Additionally, as shown by immunocytochemistry, MyoD and p21 could be detected in nearly all myoblasts after a 24-h incubation with IGF-I, while few cells expressed either protein after treatment with PDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C). Thus, IGF-I caused a progressive and sustained induction of MyoD and p21 mRNA and protein expression in C2AS12 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Forced Expression of MyoD or p21 Promotes Myoblast Survival</title><p>We next asked whether MyoD or p21 could maintain muscle cell survival in the absence of growth-factor treatment. We generated bicistronic expression plasmids using cDNAs for mouse MyoD or mouse p21, followed by a cassette containing an IRES derived from murine encephalomyocarditis virus and the marker protein EGFP. C2AS12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with these recombinant plasmids or with a control encoding EGFP alone, and cell survival was measured by cell counting after 24 h in DM.

C2AS12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with the MyoD expression plasmid and cells were immunostained for p21 after incubation for 24 h in DM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A and graphed in B, MyoD induced p21 protein expression in the majority of transfected cells (75 &#x000b1; 5%), compared with only 25 &#x000b1; 2% of cells transfected with EGFP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005), a value similar to that seen in nontransfected myoblasts (data not shown). To determine whether p21 was necessary for MyoD-mediated muscle cell survival, we cotransfected C2AS12 myoblasts with MyoD and either a p21 antisense plasmid (p21<sub>AS</sub>) or a plasmid encoding EGFP. We have shown recently that this p21<sub>AS</sub> cDNA blocked IGF-induced p21 protein expression in C2AS12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LawlorandRotwein2000">Lawlor and Rotwein 2000</xref>).

Since both MyoD and p21 are induced by IGF-I, and MyoD stimulates expression of p21, we next asked if MyoD was a necessary component of an IGF-stimulated muscle cell survival pathway. We first tested the effectiveness of a MyoD antisense cDNA (MyoD<sub>AS</sub>) to prevent IGF-stimulated MyoD protein expression. C2AS12 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing a mouse MyoD cDNA in the antisense orientation (MyoD<sub>AS</sub>-IRES-EGFP), and were immunostained for MyoD after a 24-h incubation in DM plus IGF-I. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, the MyoD<sub>AS</sub> plasmid caused a marked reduction in IGF-stimulated expression of MyoD. MyoD was detected in only 34 &#x000b1; 2% of transfected cells, compared with 78 &#x000b1; 5% of myoblasts transfected with EGFP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.014).</p><p>The MyoD<sub>AS</sub> plasmid did not reduce IGF-mediated muscle cell viability. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A, IGF-I maintained complete survival of myoblasts transfected with the MyoD<sub>AS</sub> cDNA. In the absence of growth factor treatment, 49 &#x000b1; 5% of transfected cells remained alive after a 24-h incubation in DM, a level similar to that seen in nontransfected myoblasts (48 &#x000b1; 1%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and contrasting with the 82 &#x000b1; 4% viability of cells transfected with the MyoD sense vector (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.016). In contrast with our recent observations that a p21<sub>AS</sub> plasmid inhibited IGF-mediated muscle cell survival (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LawlorandRotwein2000">Lawlor and Rotwein 2000</xref>), forced expression of the MyoD<sub>AS</sub> plasmid did not attenuate the ability of IGF-I to promote complete myoblast viability (100 &#x000b1; 3%). These results indicate that while MyoD can sustain muscle cell viability through p21, it is not necessary for IGF-regulated myoblast survival. Based on these observations, we next asked if IGF-I could stimulate p21 expression in cells transfected with the MyoD<sub>AS</sub> plasmid. As shown by immunocytochemistry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, incubation with IGF-I equivalently induced p21 in myoblasts transfected with MyoD<sub>AS</sub> or EGFP (84% for MyoD<sub>AS</sub> vs. 78% for EGFP).

Taken together with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, these observations indicate that induction of p21 expression by MyoD is not a critical pathway for IGF-mediated muscle cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential Expression of MyoD and p21 by IGF-activated Signaling Pathways</title><p>The results described above suggest that IGF-I induces the expression of MyoD and p21 by distinct mechanisms. In recent studies, we demonstrated that IGF-I treatment resulted in the sustained stimulation of both PI3-kinase and Akt kinase activities in muscle cells, and showed that a constitutively active PI3-kinase or an inducible Akt could maintain myoblast survival in the absence of growth factors (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lawloretal2000">Lawlor et al. 2000</xref>). Based on these observations and on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we next asked if either signaling molecule was involved in IGF-mediated stimulation of MyoD or p21. Transient transfection of an active PI3-kinase (p110*) into C2AS12 myoblasts led to the induction of MyoD and p21 in the absence of IGF-I treatment, as determined by immunocytochemistry after a 24-h incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Over 80% of cells positive for p110* also expressed both MyoD and p21. By contrast, in cells transfected with an inactive PI3-kinase (p110&#x00394;kin), the level of expression of MyoD or p21 (31&#x02013;36%) did not exceed values detected in nontransfected myoblasts (data not shown). Thus, PI3-kinase can coordinately stimulate the expression of MyoD and p21 in muscle cells.</p><p>We next examined the ability of Akt to stimulate MyoD and p21 protein accumulation. Myoblasts were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding hydroxytamoxifen (HT)-inducible HA-tagged Akt (iAkt), and MyoD and p21 were detected by immunocytochemistry after incubation for 24 h in DM without or with HT. Upon transfection with the iAkt plasmid, Akt protein is expressed, but its enzymatic activity requires induction by HT (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lawloretal2000">Lawlor et al. 2000</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> A, HT treatment had little effect on the low level of MyoD protein accumulation observed (36 &#x000b1; 2% vs. 33 &#x000b1; 2% without HT, <italic>P</italic> = NS).

Based on these observations, and on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, we conclude that IGF-activated signal transduction pathways control muscle cell survival by at least two mechanisms, one involving induction of MyoD mRNA and protein through PI3-kinase, with the subsequent stimulation of p21 expression, and the other through induction of p21 by Akt.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Muscle differentiation is a multi-step process involving permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle, expression of muscle-specific genes and proteins, and fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lassaretal1994">Lassar et al. 1994</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ArnoldandWinter1998">Arnold and Winter 1998</xref>). In this paper, we focus on steps involved in control of myoblast survival during early phases of differentiation. We show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, plays a key role in maintaining muscle cell viability and that its expression is regulated by two interdependent, yet distinguishable pathways. One pathway involves stimulation of MyoD expression by PI3-kinase, and subsequent induction of p21 by MyoD&#x0003b; the other involves activation of Akt by PI3-kinase, followed by stimulation of p21 expression. Both pathways collaborate to maintain survival and are connected through PI3-kinase, which itself is required for IGF-regulated muscle cell viability (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lawloretal2000">Lawlor et al. 2000</xref>). The pathways diverge distal to PI3-kinase, as Akt induces expression of p21 but not MyoD, and inhibition of MyoD does not prevent IGF-stimulated production of p21 or IGF-mediated myoblast survival. A diagram outlining the interrelationships between these pathways is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>.</p><p>It has been established in cultured muscle cells that p21 mRNA and protein expression increase dramatically with the onset of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Guoetal1995">Guo et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>), and that p21 contributes to the cell cycle arrest and resistance to apoptosis that occur early in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="AndresandWalsh1996">Andres and Walsh 1996</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="WangandWalsh1996">Wang and Walsh 1996</xref>). Although p21 null mice do not demonstrate abnormalities in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dengetal1995">Deng et al. 1995</xref>), mice deficient in both p21 and the related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p57, display marked defects in muscle differentiation and exhibit increased myoblast apoptosis during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1999">Zhang et al. 1999</xref>). These results confirm observations made with cultured muscle cells, but illustrate the complexity and functional redundancy within this family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in vivo. Little p57 can be detected in C2 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1999">Zhang et al. 1999</xref>), thus explaining why abrogation of p21 expression enhances cell death. A major function for p21 (and presumably p57) in muscle cells is to promote arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, which otherwise would phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma protein, pRb (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Elledge1996">Elledge 1996</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="JacksandWeinberg1998">Jacks and Weinberg 1998</xref>). Active pRb in turn restrains E2F transcription factors, thus preventing induction of genes involved in cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Weinberg1995">Weinberg 1995</xref>). It remains to be established whether this is also the mechanism by which p21 sustains myoblast survival. Of interest, transgenic mice expressing low levels of pRb in an otherwise pRb null background have muscle defects similar to those of p21- and p57-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zackenhausetal1996">Zackenhaus et al. 1996</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown by several investigators that MyoD induces p21 gene and protein expression in differentiating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Guoetal1995">Guo et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>), in fibroblasts from intact and p53-deficient mice, and in other cell types by transcriptional pathways (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Halevyetal1995">Halevy et al. 1995</xref>) that are not dependent on ongoing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ottenetal1997">Otten et al. 1997</xref>), implying that MyoD transactivates the p21 gene. Our results now define a MyoD-independent mechanism for controlling p21 expression in muscle cells through an IGF-I&#x02013;activated signal transduction pathway involving PI3-kinase and Akt. Previously published experiments from others also may be interpreted to support the idea that MyoD and p53 are not the only factors regulating p21 expression in muscle. During embryonic development in mice, p21 mRNA is detected in somites destined to form muscle at day 8.5 post coital, a full 2 d before MyoD gene expression is measurable (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>). In addition, p21 mRNA is equivalently expressed in presumptive muscle in developing wild-type mice and in mice lacking both MyoD and myogenin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Parkeretal1995">Parker et al. 1995</xref>). It has not been established if other myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are responsible for induction of p21 under these circumstances or whether additional pathways are involved, such as those activated by the IGF-I receptor. Since IGF-II is strongly expressed in the somites at day 8.5 post coital and throughout muscle development in mice (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Leeetal1990">Lee et al. 1990</xref>), it is conceivable that IGF-mediated mechanisms contribute to MyoD-independent regulation of p21 expression during embryonic development.</p><p>IGF-I receptor null mice also display muscle hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1993">Liu et al. 1993</xref>), but it is not known whether the underlying defect results from decreased proliferation of muscle precursor cells or from increased apoptosis. In this report, we define two IGF-I receptor-activated survival pathways in cultured myoblasts that require PI3-kinase. A role for PI3-kinase in muscle differentiation had been established previously. Inhibition of kinase activity had been shown to blunt differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kalimanetal1996">Kaliman et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kalimanetal1998">Kaliman et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Coolicanetal1997">Coolican et al. 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Jiangetal1998">Jiang et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Jiangetal1999">Jiang et al. 1999</xref>), and forced expression of active enzyme had been found to enhance differentiation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Jiangetal1998">Jiang et al. 1998</xref>), although in no studies have the downstream signaling pathways been delineated. We now demonstrate that activation of PI3-kinase leads to induction of MyoD expression by a mechanism that does not appear to require Akt. Other downstream effectors of PI3-kinase have been identified in several cell types, including p70 S6 kinase, and atypical protein kinases C, &#x003b4;, and &#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chouetal1998">Chou et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LeGoodetal1998">Le Good et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pullenetal1998">Pullen et al. 1998</xref>). We have been unable to establish in preliminary experiments a role for either p70 S6 kinase or protein kinase C &#x003b6; in myoblast survival (data not shown).

It remains to be determined whether similarly multilayered interdependent pathways control p21 gene expression in vivo, where they potentially may act to modulate myoblast viability and muscle mass during embryonic and adult life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the following individuals for plasmids: Dr. Richard Roth (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) for iAkt, Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) for the mouse p21 cDNA, Dr. Anke Klippel (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) for constitutively active and inert PI3-kinases, Dr. Andrew Lassar (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) for mouse MyoD, and Dr. Alex Toker (Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Boston, MA) for protein kinase C &#x003b6;.

Ligand-induced activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) leads to stimulation of PI3-kinase enzymatic activity through the adapter molecules, IRS-1 and -2. PI3-kinase subsequently activates Akt, which stimulates expression of p21 mRNA and protein, which then promotes muscle cell survival. PI3-kinase through unidentified steps also stimulates expression of MyoD, which then induces p21.
