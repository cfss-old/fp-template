Here we demonstrate that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumour-suppressive role in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Indeed, lung tissue-specific inactivation of <italic>Stat3</italic> in mice results in increased <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup>-driven AC initiation and malignant progression leading to markedly reduced survival. Knockdown of STAT3 in xenografted human AC cells increases tumour growth. Clinically, low <italic>STAT3</italic> expression levels correlate with poor survival and advanced malignancy in human lung AC patients with smoking history, which are prone to <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. Consistently, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung tumours exhibit reduced STAT3 levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that STAT3 controls NF-&#x003ba;B-induced <italic>IL-8</italic> expression by sequestering NF-&#x003ba;B within the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting IL-8-mediated myeloid tumour infiltration and tumour vascularization and hence tumour progression. These results elucidate a novel STAT3&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;IL-8 axis in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant AC with therapeutic and prognostic relevance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

The most frequent genetic alterations found in lung adenocarcinomas (ACs) are missense mutations and amplifications of kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (<italic>KRAS)</italic> and epidermal growth factor receptor <italic>(EGFR)</italic> in about 30% and 20% of all Caucasian cases, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although several targeted anti-EGFR therapies are effective in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations, oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> is still considered as an undruggable target. To elucidate further treatment strategies, the focus has therefore shifted towards KRAS-cooperating and downstream signalling pathways. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<italic>STAT3</italic>) represents one important transcription factor thought to cooperate with <italic>rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS)</italic> mutations during tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. STAT3 is activated in response to several cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin-M (OSM) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon binding of the ligand to its cognate receptor, STAT3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and forms homodimers or heterodimers before translocating into the nucleus to induce the transcription of several target genes implicated in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumour invasion and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Depending on the oncogenic driver mutation or on the cell type, STAT3 has been reported to play either pro-oncogenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> or tumour-suppressive roles <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Interestingly, STAT3 was shown to be activated in 54% of lung AC patient samples and human lung cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Furthermore, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> and xenograft models, STAT3 is thought to play a tumour-promoting role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and during acquired drug resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of STAT3 during oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic>-driven lung tumorigenesis using the Cre-inducible Lox-Stop-Lox-<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> knock-in lung cancer mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and a human xenograft model. Surprisingly, our results show that STAT3 functions as tumour suppressor in <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup> lung tumours as well as <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant human AC cell lines. Deletion of STAT3 in <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup> lung tumours and human AC resulted in an increased tumour growth, higher tumour grade, increased vascularization, changes in the tumour microenvironment and significantly reduced survival. Mechanistically, we show that genetic ablation of <italic>Stat3</italic> in murine as well as knockdown of <italic>STAT3</italic> in human cells resulted in an increase of nuclear factor-kappa B (<italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic>)-induced expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine ligand 1 (<italic>CXCL1</italic>; murine orthologue to the human <italic>IL-8</italic>), thereby promoting tumour growth. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCL1&#x02019;s cognate receptor CXCR2 normalizes tumour vascularization and microenvironment and reduces tumour burden. Thus, STAT3 functions as tumour suppressor by sequestering NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm and thereby reducing NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent <italic>CXCL1</italic> transcription.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>STAT3 suppresses <italic>Kras</italic>-induced lung tumorigenesis</title><p>First, we investigated the activation status of STAT3 within murine <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-driven lung tumours. In all, 20&#x02013;30% of tumour cells showed active STAT3 (tyrosine 705 phosphorylated STAT3) throughout tumour development. ELISA analysis revealed increased expression of STAT3-activating cytokines such as EGF, OSM and IL-6 in lungs harbouring <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-driven tumours compared with healthy control lungs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>).</p><p>To functionally test the role of STAT3 during <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-driven lung tumour formation, we crossed the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-G12D/+</italic></sup> strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> with conditional <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Lung epithelial-specific activation of oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup> and concomitant deletion of <italic>Stat3</italic> was achieved by adenoviral delivery of Cre-recombinase (AdCre) through inhalation of 8- to 10-week-old <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-G12D/+</italic></sup> mice (<italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic>/+</sup> hereafter; <sup><italic>&#x00394;</italic>Lep</sup>: deleted in the lung epithelium). Efficient deletion of <italic>Stat3</italic> in lung tumour cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of total STAT3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Notably, genetic ablation of <italic>Stat3</italic> resulted in a markedly shortened survival. Although <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> males showed a median survival of 118 days post AdCre infection, the control <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>+/+</sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> male littermates survived 175 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, heterozygous loss of STAT3 within the tumours (<italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/+</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup>) led to the same drastic phenotype as observed in <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> animals with a median survival of 108 days. Of note, female <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup> mice showed a less pronounced survival disadvantage when compared with their female littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p>We performed tumour analysis in male mice at three different stages: 6, 10 and 13 weeks post AdCre-induction. <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> mice revealed a dramatically increased tumour burden compared with littermate controls at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Already 6 weeks after tumour induction, <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic>/+</sup> mice showed an increased number of hyperplasia (including multifocal pneumocyte hyperplasia and adenoma) as well as malignant <italic>in situ</italic> ACs compared with control <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic>/+</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). At 13 weeks post AdCre-induction, the size of ACs spreading throughout the whole lung precluded analysis of individual tumours. Therefore, we assessed tumour area/lung area and observed significantly increased areas of multifocal hyperplasia and <italic>in situ</italic> ACs in <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> mice compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Of note, small areas of invasive ACs were observed in both experimental groups at 13 weeks post AdCre inhalation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). In line with these observations, <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient multifocal hyperplasia at 6 and 13 weeks as well as <italic>in situ</italic> ACs at 6 weeks post AdCre infection displayed significantly enhanced cell proliferation compared with tumours from <italic>Stat3</italic>-proficient control littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>), whereas the low amount of apoptosis observed in the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-driven lung tumours was not altered upon genetic ablation of STAT3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). In addition, xenograft experiments using the human AC cell line A549, which carries a <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in the same amino acid as our mouse lung cancer model (G12S), showed increased tumour growth upon <italic>STAT3</italic> knockdown, thus confirming the observations made in the mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Together, these data show that <italic>STAT3</italic> suppresses tumorigenesis of <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-driven lung tumours in mouse and human xenograft models.</p><p>Given these results, we hypothesized that human AC with a molecular signature similar to <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours might have a worse prognosis. To test this idea, microarray data were used to identify differentially expressed genes between <italic>Stat3</italic>-proficient and <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours isolated 13 weeks post induction. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;Lep/&#x00394;Lep</italic></sup>:<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> tumours indeed showed significant positive enrichment for genes associated with poor prognosis in human AC lung cancers and, conversely, significant negative enrichment for genes associated with good prognosis in humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>These data show that <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours share a transcriptional profile with advanced progression and poor prognosis observed in human AC. In addition, the gene expression profile of murine <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> tumours devoid of STAT3 signalling significantly overlapped with human <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung AC, and, conversely, murine <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> tumours competent of STAT3 signalling showed a significant enrichment for genes usually downregulated in human <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung AC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). This result led us to test whether <italic>STAT3</italic> signalling is perturbed in human lung ACs and we analysed four different patient cohorts. Interestingly, we found a significant decrease in <italic>STAT3</italic> expression levels in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant human tumours compared with lung tumours with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> in the first cohort of smoking patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). STAT3 activation status was significantly reduced when compared with an <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the second cohort containing 139 patients with known smoking history showed that <italic>STAT3</italic> expression is significantly reduced in grade III tumours (with high metastatic potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=&#x0003c;0.0001)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Furthermore, in this patient cohort we found that low <italic>STAT3</italic> expression levels correlate with reduced overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.017)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Of note, it is well established that smoking is strongly associated with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Increased levels of nuclear p65 were obtained upon TNF &#x003b1; stimulation, which was reduced to basal levels upon co-stimulation with OSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). To further confirm this, we analysed the subcellular localization of p65 using immunofluorescence imaging of STAT3-proficient A549 cells and compared it to the STAT3 knockdown cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).

These findings made STAT3 an attractive drug target to treat NSCLC patients. We hypothesized that lung AC patients, especially those with activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, might also benefit from STAT3 inhibition. As <italic>KRAS</italic> is still considered as an undruggable target and is responsible for 30% of all Caucasian AC cases, we investigated whether STAT3 inhibition has a potential survival benefit in a preclinical lung cancer mouse model and in a human cell line xenograft model. However, our results clearly show that STAT3 behaves as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor during <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>-induced lung tumorigenesis.

Despite the fact that <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours had a growth advantage, they did not progress to become more invasive than <italic>Stat3</italic>-proficient tumours or metastatic. Tumour invasion and metastasis are a multistage development in which, in addition to neo-angiogenesis, malignant tumour cells have to undergo EMT, detach from the primary tumour, migrate and pass mechanical barriers.

In agreement with this, we could confirm that <italic>IL-8</italic> expression tends to correlate with poor survival in smoking patients (who frequently acquire <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations) within the publically available AC patient cohort used in this study. Interestingly, we could also show that low STAT3 expression has a tendency to correlate with increased <italic>IL-8</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant patient samples.</p><p>To investigate whether CXCL1 is the central angiogenesis and tumour-promoting factor in our model and a potential therapeutic target, we treated the mice with SB225002, a small-molecule antagonist of CXCR2. Treating <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient mice at tumour initiation resulted in a reduction of tumour growth as well as a decrease in vascularization compared with vehicle-treated control mice. This result corroborates that CXCL1 signalling indeed accelerates tumour growth at early stages. In addition, we cannot rule out that CXCL1 also acts as an autocrine tumour-promoting factor in lung cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. We also tried to validate CXCL1 as a therapeutic target by blocking CXCL1 signalling in established tumours. By using this approach, we could show that tumour vascularization and infiltration of macrophages were reduced at the end stage of the treatment; however, we did not observe any effect on tumour growth. This result indicates that other effectors in <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours, like elevated NF-&#x003ba;B activity and/or increased <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression, may contribute to tumour proliferation at late stages. Nevertheless, although late-stage <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient tumours failed to respond to an anti-CXCL1 monotherapy, the use of CXCL1 blockers combined with standard chemotherapy or as maintenance therapy could be a reasonable alternative to treat these tumours and it deserves further investigation. To substantiate these findings, we inhibited IL-8 signalling in <italic>STAT3</italic> knockdown human lung AC cells. Short hairpin-mediated <italic>IL-8</italic>/<italic>STAT3</italic> double knockdown resulted in a reduction in tumour growth, tumour vascularization and macrophage infiltration compared with <italic>STAT3</italic> single knockdown within the human A549 xenograft model. These results confirm the central role of CXCL1/IL-8 signalling in mutated <italic>KRAS</italic> STAT3-deficient murine and human xenograft tumours.</p><p>Mechanistically, we show that STAT3 signalling can repress NF-&#x003ba;B-driven <italic>CXCL1/IL-8</italic> expression not only in primary mouse pneumocytes but also in human lung AC cells. Furthermore, we show that tumours lacking <italic>Stat3</italic> showed increased nuclear p-p65 concomitant with increased expression of CXCL1 and other typical NF-&#x003ba;B target genes, such as <italic>Tnf&#x003b1;, c-Myc</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic>, which was also shown by others in A549 cells as well as in glioblastoma cells upon STAT3 blockade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Although STAT3 as well as other STAT family members has been shown to compete with NF-&#x003ba;B on various promoter regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, we could not detect direct STAT3 binding to the <italic>CXCL1</italic> promoter. We found that activation of STAT3 results in binding to and retention of NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm, thereby reducing NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity. In line with these results, <italic>Stat3</italic> deficiency in dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> and splenocytes as well as knockdown or inhibition of STAT3 within melanoma or prostate cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> causes increased phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, indicating that STAT3 can also impinge on NF-&#x003ba;B activity further upstream in the inhibitory complex formation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Interestingly, mucinous lung AC patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations not only show reduced STAT3 expression levels but also reduced STAT3 activation levels compared with smoking patients without <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and to <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cases. Further analysis revealed that more tumours with high granulocyte and low lymphocyte infiltration were found within <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant patient samples. In addition, low STAT3 expression tends to correlate with increased NF-&#x003ba;B and <italic>IL-8</italic> expression. Nevertheless, increased patient numbers are needed to substantiate these findings. Furthermore, in lung AC patients with a known smoking history, a patient subgroup associated with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, we found a significant correlation between lower STAT3 expression and poor survival. In line, those tumours with advanced stage (grade III) had significantly less <italic>STAT3</italic> expression, indicating that <italic>STAT3</italic> downregulation seems to be beneficial for tumour progression. Furthermore, two additional independent data sets confirmed that <italic>STAT3</italic> expression was significantly downregulated in high-risk patients with subsequent poor survival outcome in lung AC patients. GSEA further showed that our murine <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> tumours strongly correlate with a gene expression signature associated with human <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung tumours, and importantly, also with a poor prognosis-gene signature&#x02014;more than <italic>Stat3</italic>-proficient <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> tumours. These data suggest that our observations in the <italic>Stat3</italic>-deficient <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> mouse model are actually reflecting the human situation where tumour grade and poor prognosis correlate with low STAT3 expression in lung AC patients.</p><p>Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and xenograft models, STAT3 is considered to play a tumour-promoting role in <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant NSCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, therefore, inhibition of STAT3 is considered as therapeutic intervention in lung ACs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We have demonstrated that STAT3 has a tumour-suppressor function in murine <italic>Kras</italic> mutant lung cancer as well as in human <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant xenografts. Although further clinical investigations will be required, our data suggest that those lung AC patients harbouring <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations or a known smoking history (as a surrogate marker for <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations), may not respond to STAT3 inhibitors but may likely suffer severe adverse effects. This highlights the importance of stratifying patients according to their driver mutation for further therapeutic interventions. In addition, our study also proposes a re-evaluation of STAT3 inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> as therapeutic strategies for any inflammatory or fibrotic disease or cancer, as inhibition of STAT3 <italic>in vivo</italic> might bear the risk of triggering malignant transformation of incipient pre-malignant cells harbouring <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations within the lung.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tumour induction and inhibitor administration in mice</title><p>Mice carrying the <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>floxed</italic></sup> allele<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> were crossed with the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSLG12D/+</italic></sup> knock-in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> to generate <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>:Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D/+</italic></sup> mice maintained on a C57BL6/N background.

Quantification of tumour area, tumour number and tumour grade was done with HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics GmbH) and visually controlled by two independent pathologists (R.H.Z. and H.P.) in a blind manner. Tumour grade was classified as following: hyperplasia includes diffuse hyperplasia of pneumocytes type II and adenomas. The first is a diffuse proliferation, whereas adenomas are circumscribed. Adenomas can be composed of transformed pneumocytes type II but also can contain some Clara cells. Both lesions represent non-malignant proliferations, have a compact cell mass, alveolar septae are still intact and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio is still regular. <italic>In situ</italic> ACs grow along preexisting alveolar septae, have prominent nucleoli and an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, but still low mitotic counts per high-power field.
