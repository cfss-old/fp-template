Currently, most protocols for generating high-titer lentivirus require ultracentrifugation, which can be an instrumental barrier for routine operations in a laboratory. In this study, the effect of relative centrifugal force (RCF) on the concentration efficiency of the lentivirus was systematically explored, and it was found that sucrose gradient centrifugation with a relatively low speed (&#x02264;10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>) robustly produces a high-titer virus (up to 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml). The optimal sucrose concentration is 10%, and the recovery rate of the functional virus is greater than 80%. The infection efficiency of both concentrated and un-concentrated lentivirus decreases rapidly when the viruses are stored at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (&#x003c4;&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;1.3 days) or subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles (&#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 rounds). In summary, we describe an efficient and easy-to-handle protocol for high-titer lentivirus purification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-derived lentivirus belongs to the Retroviridae family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It is characterized by incorporating viral RNA into the DNA of dividing and non-dividing cells. To produce a lentivirus that is capable of infecting host cells, three types of vectors must be co-expressed in virus-producing cells (typically HEK293T cells): a backbone vector containing the transgene of interests and self-inactivating 3&#x02032;-LTR regions, one construct expressing viral structure proteins, and one vector encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) for encapsulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The latest generation of the lentivirus system further separates the Rev gene from other structural genes, offering increased biosafety by reducing the possibility of reverse recombination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Nowadays, lentivirus technology has become one of the most efficient tools to deliver exogenous genes into various types of cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The purification of high-titer lentivirus (&#x0003e;10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml) from a large volume of virus-containing medium is crucial for the application of lentivirus. The routine concentration of the lentivirus requires ultracentrifugation with relative centrifugal force (RCF), typically exceeding 90,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, to remove impurities and to ensure a high infection rate, especially for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. This can be achieved only by an ultracentrifuge, which is not a common instrument in a lab. Moreover, the ability of low-speed centrifugation to produce a high-titer virus has not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, the relationship between RCF and the concentration efficiency of the lentivirus was systematically evaluated, and the present data showed that sucrose gradient centrifugation with a relatively low speed (&#x02264;10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>) produces a high-titer virus that is comparable to a commercially available virus purified with ultracentrifugation in both yield and titer. Moreover, the optimal sucrose concentration is 10%. Thus, an efficient protocol for high-titer lentivirus purification that is easily achieved with a regular lab centrifuge is described.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To examine the lower limit of RCF, which could produce a reasonable yield of the high-titer lentivirus, the effect of RCF (1,000&#x02013;10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>) on the concentration efficiency was examined. The HEK293T cells were transfected with a packaging vector expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) along with transfer and envelope vectors, and the virus-containing medium being collected at 48&#x02009;hours after transfection was used as the starting materials for the concentration. To measure the titer of the functional virus, the concentrated virus was added to the HEK293T cells, and the percentage and relative intensity of the GFP-positive cells were measured with a flow cytometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We used a 20% sucrose gradient centrifugation for 4&#x02009;hours, which is most commonly used in published protocols, as the starting point. The concentration of functional virion particles, reflected as the percentage of the cells infected, was increased in a linear relationship with RCF in the range of 2,000&#x02013;10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). The virus purified with 1,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugation showed almost no significant transduction ability in the HEK293T cells. The fluorescent intensity of the transduced HEK293T cells showed no significant differences in any of the concentrated viruses purified with various RCF tests. The concentration of viral genomes of the purified lentivirus was also measured using the RT-PCR method. Consistently, sucrose gradient centrifugation with a relatively low speed (&#x02264;10,000&#x02009;g) robustly produces a high-titer virus in a RCF-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The recovery yield of 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugation was 85.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07% (suppl. Fig. 1). Intriguingly, 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugation showed a 185.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23.7% transduction efficiency compared with the ultracentrifuge at the speed of 90,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> for 90&#x02009;minutes with otherwise identical settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To test whether the different transduction efficiency was due to the different centrifugation time, the different speed, or both, a set of experiments were performed to compare the concentration efficiencies among the lentiviruses purified at various RCFs for various durations. The results show that the transduction efficiency had a linear relationship with the RCF in the range of 0&#x02013;10000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>, and remained stable in the range of 10000&#x02013;90000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugation for either 1.5 or 4&#x02009;hours; however, the virus purified with centrifugation for 1.5&#x02009;hrs always showed significantly less transduction efficiency compared with 4&#x02009;hrs at all of the RCFs tested (suppl. Fig. 2). The impurity of the lentivirus preparations is an important issue, especially in <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Thus, silver staining experiments were performed to examine the lentivirus purity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>, the virus purified using the low-speed centrifugation method contained as few contaminating proteins as the equivalent amounts of the lentivirus purchased commercially.</p><p>Because 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> RCF could easily be achieved with most tabletop centrifuges and produces a superior yield of the concentrated virus, 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> was set as the standard RCF for the optimization of other purification parameters. The effect of the centrifugation time on the virus transduction efficiency was first examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>, the efficiency increased in a linear relationship with the centrifugation time and reached a plateau after 4&#x02009;hours. Next, whether or not the sucrose concentration in the centrifugation buffer could affect the virus enrichment was tested. The osmotic of the centrifugation buffer was between 265.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.00&#x02009;mOsm/L and 2,143&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.819&#x02009;mOsm/L from 0% to 50% of the sucrose concentration in the buffer (suppl. Fig. 3). Without sucrose in the buffer, the transduction of the concentrated virus was very low. In the concentration window between 10% and 30% of sucrose, this purification method showed reliable performance in enriching the GFP-expressing lentivirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), and a more detailed analysis showed that 10% of sucrose exhibited the best effect in the virus concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Compared with other viruses, such as the Adeno-associated virus (AAV), the lentivirus is more fragile and subject to damage during purification. To test whether or not the acceleration or brake speed during centrifugation would affect the viability of the concentrated virus, two parameter sets&#x02014;slow mode (acceleration and brake time of 146 and 172&#x02009;seconds, respectively) and fast mode (acceleration and brake time of 62 and 35&#x02009;seconds, respectively)&#x02014;were tested when the centrifugation RCF was set to 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic>. The data showed that the virus concentrated in the slow mode was slightly but significantly more efficient (118.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.81%) in infecting cells compared with the fast mode.</p><p>After concentration, the purified virus is typically either used for a short period of time or aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for long-term usage. Thus, the change in the virus titer upon prolonged storage of the lentivirus at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the infection efficiency of the un-concentrated and concentrated viruses was reduced exponentially (&#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.4 days and 1.3 days, respectively). The stability of the commercial-purchased virus was also measured, and it was found that the infection efficiency was reduced exponentially (&#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9 days), which is similar to the un-concentrated virus and the concentrated virus purified by 10000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> purification (suppl. Fig. 4). Next, the effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on the infection efficiency of the virus was tested. During the test, the frozen virus was thawed at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;minutes and added to the cells immediately at a 1:50 ratio. The results showed that the infection efficiency after one round of freeze and thaw was reduced by 33.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4% (&#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 rounds, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To increase the yield of the lentivirus production, experimenters sometimes collect virus-containing medium from transfected HEK293T cells twice, once during the first 48&#x02009;hours and again 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;hours after transfection. The results in this study consistently showed no significant difference in the infection efficiency or the fluorescent intensity of the cells infected with the viruses produced between 0 and 48&#x02009;hours and between 48 and 72&#x02009;hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>One of the major uses of the lentivirus is to infect non-dividing cells, such as neurons, for both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The virus purified with 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugation was tested under both circumstances. The hippocampal neuronal cultures (8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;cells per coverslip in a 24-well plate) were infected with 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of the virus (2.04&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, almost 100% of the neurons showed GFP fluorescence at days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 14 when the concentrated virus was added at DIV 4. To test whether or not the concentrated virus may affect the growth of the neural cells, the miniature excitatory postsynaptic synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic currents (mIPSCs) of the infected neurons were measured and compared with the uninfected neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, the mEPSCs and mIPSCs were normal both in frequencies and in amplitudes, implying that the addition of the concentrated virus did not cause detectable toxic effects to the neurons. In addition, the miniature synaptic transmission from the neurons infected with purified lentivirus at DIV 10 was measured when the synapses had already formed. The results show that the virus infection had no effect on the synaptic transmission, implying that the neurons in the late development stage (DIV 10) were not affected by the virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Using a stereotaxic injection, the concentrated virus was injected into the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in newborn mice pups. The GFP-positive CA1 and CA3 neurons were observed at P12, demonstrating the <italic>in vivo</italic> application of the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). To further test whether or not the injected virus might result in a significant immune response, we detected the GFAP-positive astrocytes on hippocampal tissue slides from mice injected unilaterally with the lentivirus purified with 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> centrifugations. The results show that no significant aggregation of GFAP-positive astrocytes were observed around the virus-injected sites in CA3 or CA1 region of hippocampus comparing to the uninjected hippocampus (suppl. Fig. 5). Thus, these results showed that the virus enriched with our method is capable of expressing exogenous genes in the non-dividing cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purification of high-titer lentivirus is always a bottleneck for the application of lentivirus in a lab. Although other purification methods involving anion exchange HPLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> or ultrafiltration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> have been reported, ultracentrifugation is still the most widely used method to concentrate lentivirus; however, the requirement of ultracentrifugation may represent an instrumental barrier in the concentration process. Here, the data demonstrated that the lentivirus can be concentrated with a sucrose gradient centrifugation at 10,000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> RCF, a centrifuge force easily achieved using a regular tabletop centrifuge. Furthermore, this method can be easily modified for the large-scale preparation of lentiviral stock. The titer of the concentrated virus in the results varied between 2.04&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml and 2.00&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml, largely depending on the volume of the initial materials. For example, with 50&#x02009;ml of a virus-containing medium collected from transfected HEK293T cells, the concentration ratio is about 1:500, and the final volume is 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;l. Using the high-titer lentivirus (1.32&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml), which is commercially purchased as the standard, the concentrated lentivirus prepared with a 1:500 concentration ratio reached a titer of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml (suppl. Figs 6 and 7). Moreover, the data showed that the concentrated virus purified using this method does not affect the synaptic transmission in cultured primary neurons, which is a sensitive cell preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Several alternative methods have been reported to purify high-titer lentivirus preparations, which bypassed ultracentrifugation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Ion exchange chromatography was used to purify lentiviral particles based on the fact that lentivirus are retained by the anionic exchange columns and can be eluted subsequently with buffers containing a high concentration of salts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This method has the advantage of removing more cell debris compared with the ultracentrifugation. Ultrafiltration using Centricon units with a cut-off at 100&#x02009;kDa in molecular weight was also reported to generate lentivirus vectors up to 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;c.f.u./ml devoid of re-suspension problems in ultracentrifugation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation is another simple and efficient way to purify large volumes of lentivirus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The method presented in this study is relatively simple and does not require special instrumentation or handling. With comparable transduction efficiency (&#x0223c;10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;TU/ml), this method is relatively time-effective and especially suitable for handling a large variety of lentivirus purifications. In summary, a relatively simple and practical method to purify a high-titer and high-quality lentivirus for both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications has been described.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The HEK293T cells (CRL-11268, ATCC) were grown at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere incubator (Thermo).
