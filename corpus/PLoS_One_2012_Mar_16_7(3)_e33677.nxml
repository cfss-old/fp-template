However, issues related to data structure, nomenclature, and changes in data collection over time present challenges to the aggregate analysis and interpretation of these data in general and to the analysis of trials according to clinical specialty in particular. Improving usability of these data could enhance the utility of ClinicalTrials.gov as a research resource.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Principal Results</title><p>The purpose of our project was twofold. First, we sought to extend the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov for research purposes by developing a database for aggregate analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) that contains data from the 96,346 clinical trials registered as of September 27, 2010. Second, we developed and validated a methodology for annotating studies by clinical specialty, using a custom taxonomy employing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms applied by an NLM algorithm, as well as MeSH terms and other disease condition terms provided by study sponsors. Clinical specialists reviewed and annotated MeSH and non-MeSH disease condition terms, and an algorithm was created to classify studies into clinical specialties based on both MeSH and non-MeSH annotations. False positives and false negatives were evaluated by comparing algorithmic classification with manual classification for three specialties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The resulting AACT database features study design attributes parsed into discrete fields, integrated metadata, and an integrated MeSH thesaurus, and is available for download as Oracle extracts (.dmp file and text format). This publicly-accessible dataset will facilitate analysis of studies and permit detailed characterization and analysis of the U.S. clinical trials enterprise as a whole. In addition, the methodology we present for creating specialty datasets may facilitate other efforts to analyze studies by specialty groups.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>) is a registry of human clinical research studies. It is hosted by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As mandated by federal law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Public1">[1]</xref>, ClinicalTrials.gov provides a central resource for information about clinical trials; in addition, it increases the public visibility of such research. The registry currently contains over 100,000 research studies conducted in more than 170 countries and is widely used both by medical professionals and the public. New research studies are being submitted to the registry by their respective sponsors (or sponsors' designees) at a rate of approximately 350 per week <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-ClinicalTrialsgov1">[2]</xref>. Due to legislative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Public1">[1]</xref> and institutional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-DeAngelis1">[3]</xref> requirements enacted in the latter half of the previous decade, compliance with registry obligations is assumed to be high for U.S. drug and device trials, and the consistency, quality, and maintenance of registry data have improved with increased use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Zarin1">[4]</xref>. However, the registry has not been optimized for the analysis of aggregate data, and a systematic effort to create and maintain a database for this purpose has not previously been undertaken.</p><p>In November 2007, the FDA and Duke University announced the formation of a public-private partnership to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical trials. This collaboration of more than 60 organizations and government agencies was convened by Duke University under a memorandum of understanding with FDA, and is now known as the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Clinical1">[5]</xref>. CTTI leaders recognized that ClinicalTrials.gov represented a promising source for benchmarking the state of the clinical trials enterprise, as the registry contains studies from the full range of sponsoring organizations. Increasing the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov data may therefore facilitate systematic evaluation of clinical studies aimed at building the knowledge base needed to inform medical practice and prevention.</p><p>As data have accumulated in ClinicalTrials.gov, users have increasingly sought capabilities that would allow aggregated descriptive characterization of the national research portfolio; however, access and data usability issues, including data format and design, present obstacles. A number of related initiatives, including the Ontology of Clinical Research (OCRe) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Ontology1">[6]</xref>, Human Studies Database (HSDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Clinical2">[7]</xref>, CDISC Protocol Representation Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-CDISC1">[8]</xref>, and LinkedCT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-LinkedCT1">[9]</xref> projects, are addressing ontological annotations, large-scale data mining, data representation format, and external association of these data, respectively. The results of this project are complementary to these initiatives and are expected to collectively advance this area of study as a whole.</p><p>In this article, we report on CTTI's efforts to prepare and maintain a publicly accessible analysis dataset derived from ClinicalTrials.gov content&#x02014;the database for aggregate analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT). We also discuss efforts to extend the utility of the analysis dataset by means of an associated clinical specialty taxonomy designed to support research policy analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1. Creation of the AACT</title><p>Key design features of AACT include 1) the capacity to extend the dataset by parsing existing data; 2) linking to additional data resources, such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus; and 3) integrated metadata. A framework for extensions allows entire studies or individual fields to be associated with new data resources while preserving provenance. In addition, the integrated data dictionary developed for this project facilitates browsing and analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov and AACT metadata. Finally, the database incorporates a flexible design that can accommodate future developments, such as coding biospecimen type, sponsors, and OCRe annotations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033677-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows key enhancements achieved by building the AACT.</p><fig id="pone-0033677-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0033677.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of the database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.Gov (AACT) with its key enhancements.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0033677.g001"/></fig><sec id="s2a1"><title>1.1. Data Sources</title><p>A dataset comprising 96,346 clinical studies was downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov in XML format on September 27, 2010. We chose ClinicalTrials.gov for our study because it is the largest database of its kind and because it covers the full range of clinical conditions, includes a broad group of trial sponsors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Zarin2">[10]</xref>, and has a regulatory mandate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Public1">[1]</xref>. The date of download was chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the enactment of the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) 3 years earlier, which mandated the registration of certain trials of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics, and devices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Public1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>We downloaded the 2010 MeSH thesaurus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2010/download/termscon.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2010/download/termscon.html</ext-link>) and merged it with the AACT database, where it was used as a lookup table to locate corresponding tree numbers, referred to as <italic>MeSH IDs</italic>, for all MeSH terms associated with each clinical trial in ClinicalTrials.gov.

Data Model</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov data element definitions, xsd specifications for registry data submission, and downloaded study XML files were used to represent data specifications for the downloaded data. A physical data model was designed using Enterprise Architect (Sparx Systems Pty Ltd, Creswick, Victoria, Australia); this model depicted data tables and their data columns, as well as relationships between and among tables. An optimal structure was achieved through normalization, which was used to organize data efficiently, eliminate redundancy, and ensure logical data dependencies by storing only related data within a given table <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Codd1">[11]</xref>. The database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033677-g002">Figure 2</xref>) was normalized to the Second Normal Form (2NF), a set of criteria designed to prevent logical inconsistencies while reducing data redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Codd2">[12]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0033677-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0033677.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>High-level Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for AACT.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0033677.g002"/></fig><p>We assigned data type and length of data elements based on patterns observed for each data element in the downloaded XML files. Whenever possible, we followed guidelines provided in ClinicalTrials.gov's draft Protocol Data Element Definitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-ClinicalTrialsgov2">[13]</xref> when assigning lengths to given data elements. Data were housed in Oracle RDBMS, version 11.1 g (Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, California, USA). Enterprise Architect 7.1 was used for database design and additional transformation rules were documented as extract-transform-load (ETL) specifications. PL/SQL packages that used Oracle's inbuilt DBMS_LOB package to read the input XML files and load the data into the designed tables appropriately were developed. Quality control and operational support processes were developed using standard SQL queries through Toad for Data Analysts (Quest Software, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) and Cognos ReportNet (CRN) (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). We extended the core data model to accommodate both data management and data curation purposes. Error log tables and indexes were created for testing, debugging, and performance enhancement. Manual user acceptance testing was performed by randomly selecting five studies per data element (from a total of 109 data elements) from the AACT database. The values associated with each data element were tested for correctness and completeness by comparing them with the original source data from downloaded XML files. We also created integrated data dictionary tables as reference tables holding explicit data element definitions and system metadata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033677.s001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033677.s002">S2</xref>).</p><p>During the course of database development, the NLM made several new data elements available for public download, some of which included information about the FDA (e.g., Section 801 clinical trials, studies with FDA-regulated interventions, and expanded-access studies). In addition to these, MeSH condition and intervention terms generated by the NLM algorithm were also made available for public download.</p><p>In XML files downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov, the single data element <italic>Study Design</italic> contains a string of concatenated values for various different components of a study design, such as primary purpose, interventional model, observational model, allocation, endpoint classification, time perspective, and masking. While this format is well-suited for supporting information retrieval, it does not readily accommodate aggregate data analysis of the components within the <italic>Study Design</italic> data element. For this reason, data from <italic>Study Design</italic> was parsed into its components and stored in a separate table called DESIGNS. Additional data elements (<italic>Design Name</italic> and <italic>Design Value</italic>) were created to store all components of study design and their respective enumerated values. Values related to masking/blinding (e.g., <italic>Single; Double-Blind</italic>) were further parsed into their components, along with the list of corresponding masking subjects (<italic>Participant</italic>, <italic>Investigator</italic>, <italic>Outcome Assessor</italic>, and <italic>Caregiver</italic>).</p><p>Several challenges were encountered while loading the database, including foreign characters embedded in XML files with most of the data elements; these had to be replaced with character references (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0033677-t001">Table 1</xref> for examples).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0033677-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0033677.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Escape characters and replacements.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0033677-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0033677.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Escape character</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Replacement</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">'</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">'</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">"</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">"</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00026;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00026;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">"</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Other circumstances that prompted several database design iterations included the facts that the maximum length for each data element noted by ClinicalTrials.gov's May 2010 Protocol Data Element Definitions document was not always consistent with the complete dataset, and one-to-one or one-to-many relationships between or among data elements were not obvious in the XML data type definition from ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>1.3. Quality Assessment</title><p>Of the 96,346 studies downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov in September 2010, a total of 79,413 (82.4&#x00025;) were interventional (i.e., a study in which an investigator following a protocol assigns research participants to receive specific interventions, as opposed to an observational study), 16,506 (17.1&#x00025;) were observational, 107 (0.1&#x00025;) were expanded-access, and 320 had no information about the study type. We analyzed selected data elements in interventional studies for completeness of data (e.g., a null value in the data element) and observed a trend toward increasing completeness of data over time. This trend appears to have been notably affected by two milestones in the history of ClinicalTrials.gov. In September 2004, the International Council of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) published a policy requiring registration of interventional trials as a condition of publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-DeAngelis1">[3]</xref>. The ICMJE requirements took effect in September 2005, which may account for the increase in completeness for some data elements in 2005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033677-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0033677-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0033677.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Percentage of interventional studies with complete data by registration year for selected data elements.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0033677.g003"/></fig><p>In September 2007, the FDAAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Public1">[1]</xref> made the registration of interventional studies mandatory. This requirement took effect in December 2007 and may further account for increases in the completeness of data elements in the ClinicalTrials.gov dataset. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033677-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the data elements &#x0201c;data monitoring committee&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;number of arms&#x0201d; were not available at the time that earlier studies were registered. It is important to note that the presence of these data elements for studies pre-dating December 2007 reflect later updates performed by data providers.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><title>1.4. Changes in ClinicalTrials.gov's Protocol Data Element Definitions</title><p>The ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Data Element Definitions (PDED) have evolved since the database was first launched. Although references containing individual protocol data element definitions are provided for submitters with each release of the definitions document, there is no document that tracks changes for all data elements for review as data specifications. These include changing enumerated values for a data element, revising a data element definition, making a particular data element publicly available, introducing a new data element, and entirely deleting a data element. However, more rigorous submission rules imposed by mandating organizations (e.g., NLM, FDA), such as those required by the FDAAA and ClinicalTrials.gov, appear to have had the greatest impact on the completeness of data.</p><p>Changes to a data element play a significant role in the analysis of study data. As we examined each data element's history, we noted that between September 2004 and July 2005 (a period spanning 3 releases of the PDED), and again in December 2007, the data element requirements were not documented in the definitions document. Other inconsistencies were also noted and later confirmed (Personal communication, Dr. Deborah Zarin and Mr. Nicholas Ide, February 18, 2011).</p></sec><sec id="s2a5"><title>1.5. A Public Resource</title><p>The AACT can be downloaded as Oracle extracts (.dmp file and text format output; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.trialstransformation.org/projects/improving-the-public-interface-for-use-of-aggregate-data-in-clinicaltrials.gov/aact-database-for-aggregate-analysis-of-clinicaltrials.gov">https://www.trialstransformation.org/projects/improving-the-public-interface-for-use-of-aggregate-data-in-clinicaltrials.gov/aact-database-for-aggregate-analysis-of-clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). Additional documents are available to assist users in interpreting the data. The high-level data dictionary and a comprehensive data dictionary noted previously are included in the dataset file. The comprehensive data dictionary contains seven sections: 1) current variables, 2) enumerations, 3) constraints, 4) record counts, 5) database schema, 6) comprehensive change history, and 7) variable history dates. This document provides definitions, derivation of terms, data model structure and references, NLM and FDAAA requirements, and historical information for each data element in ClinicalTrials.gov to facilitate understanding of when variables were added, modified, or discontinued. The high-level data dictionary provides a summary view of the variables contained in the AACT database.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2. A Methodology to Regroup Studies in ClinicalTrials.Gov by Specialty</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov contains studies from multiple clinical domains. While the AACT database facilitates the aggregate analysis of the entire dataset, it does not in itself support analysis within specific specialty domains. We therefore developed a methodology to re-group studies from ClinicalTrials.gov by clinical specialties as designated by the Department of Health and Human Services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-US1">[14]</xref>. In doing so, we relied on MeSH condition terms and free-text disease condition terms associated with each study in the ClinicalTrials.gov database&#x02014;a method that can be used to develop other specialized datasets for analysis.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>2.1. Use of MeSH Terminology in the ClinicalTrials.gov Database</title><p>Data submitters (study sponsors or their designees) are requested to provide <italic>Condition</italic> and <italic>Keywords</italic> data as MeSH terms when registering a study. Additionally, an NLM algorithm also evaluates studies and applies MeSH terms according to the following steps: 1) study records are checked for the presence of a MeSH term, including synonyms and lexical variations; 2) weighted scores are computed for all matches, with exact matches, lexical variations, and synonyms receiving descending proportional weight; 3) very common terms are excluded to avoid confounding; 4) location by data element is considered and weighted in the term scoring process; and 5) terms with scores exceeding the cutoff value are applied to the respective studies. (Note that the output from steps 1 and 2 is used for both condition and intervention annotations; the field weights are different for each and divert terms into the target annotation type.) This method does not consider the natural-language context for matched terms or ontologically related concepts that would add specificity. Neither the terms from data submitters nor the NLM algorithm attempt to associate a term with a particular MeSH hierarchy. These resulting annotated MeSH terms are visible on the ClinicalTrials.gov website and populated in the <italic>condition_browse</italic> and <italic>intervention_browse</italic> fields in the downloaded XML file for each study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033677-g004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates how MeSH terms are created in the ClinicalTrials.gov database.</p><fig id="pone-0033677-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0033677.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>An overview of methodology and process of developing clinical specialty datasets.</title><p>The INTERVENTIONS, CONDITIONS, and KEYWORDS tables consist of disease condition terms provided by data submitters that include both MeSH and non-MeSH terms.

Specifically, we have described the procurement and generation of an integrated database; the parsing of the database's <italic>Study Design</italic> variable into a format that can be used for analysis; the creation of a change history in the underlying data element definitions; and the display of basic trends in data quality metrics.</p><p>Our novel system for classifying studies by clinical specialty is a result of combining technology with medical subject matter expertise, based on extensive data curation that incorporates coding by physicians representing relevant clinical specialties, as well as use of MeSH taxonomy and submitted disease conditions. Applying this methodology to complete a taxonomy by clinical specialty would facilitate policy-oriented investigations, such as 1) future research policy studies aimed at evaluating disparities in the geographical distribution of clinical trials and of biomedical research literature in relation to the local burden of diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-World1">[15]</xref>; 2) the comparative evolution in the number of trials and resulting publications over time by clinical specialties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Thiers1">[16]</xref>; 3) the progression of interdisciplinarity in medical specialties (by examining the degree of overlap in MeSH terms over time); and 4) the comparative distribution of evidence levels across specialties, focusing on areas historically characterized by low levels of evidence. Each of these topics is crucial, not only for ensuring alignment between regional and global healthcare needs, but also for defining evidence-based strategic plans in relation to national and regional biomedical research policies.</p><p>Despite the significant value provided by the AACT, this resource has limitations. First, ClinicalTrials.gov was primarily intended to serve as a public data repository and was not designed to support aggregate analysis. Second, the original MeSH classification was not created to accommodate hierarchical arrangement of clinical specialties and a given condition may be stored in multiple locations. Because the current MeSH structure does not allow differentiation among clinical specialties, false positive results may occur when attempting to query the database for a given condition. Third, because the methodology developed to annotate the AACT database by clinical specialty relied on a group of experts exclusively from Duke University, further validation would be appropriate. Fourth, the process for curation and development of the taxonomy were both time- and resource-intensive. For this reason, further investigation should explore methods for streamlining this process, potentially distributed across a large, open curation community. Fifth, the use of standard ontologies and vocabularies from all clinical disciplines would be ideal for encompassing a complete specialty classification. Sixth and finally, while we believe that our study classification methodologies have the potential to facilitate policy-oriented investigations, the usefulness of our approach in these arenas will need to be confirmed by more formal validation processes.</p><p>Future development for this database could expand into a number of areas. First, the curated database and, when completed, the accompanying clinical specialty taxonomy, could be represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Resource1">[17]</xref> to enable merging with the linkedCT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-LinkedCT1">[9]</xref> version of the ClinicalTrials.gov dataset and other RDF resources. Second, possible additions to the database include the standardization of sponsor lists, interventions, outcome measures, universities, and the connection to geolocation datasets such as GeoNames <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-GeoNames1">[18]</xref>. Importantly, future additions should be driven by the value they might provide to research policy makers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033677-Manifesto1">[19]</xref>, ultimately improving the quality of biomedical research and, consequently, the healthcare delivered to patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0033677.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>ClinicalTrials.gov High-level Data Dictionary.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0033677.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0033677.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Comprehensive Data Dictionary.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0033677.s002.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) leadership: Dr. Robert Califf (CTTI executive committee co-chair, Duke Translational Medicine Institute and Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC); Dr. Judith Kramer (CTTI executive director, Duke Translational Medicine Institute and Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC); and Jean Bolte (CTTI senior clinical project manager, Duke Translational Medicine Institute, Durham, NC).
