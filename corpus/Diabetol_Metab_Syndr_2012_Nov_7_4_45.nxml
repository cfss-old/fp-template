Ceramide is a well-established mediator of several health problems that arise from adipose tissue expansion. The purpose of this study was to determine whether AICAR, an AMPK-activating drug, selectively reduces skeletal muscle ceramide synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Murine myotubes and rats were challenged with palmitate and high-fat diet, respectively, to induce ceramide accrual, in the absence or presence of AICAR. Transcript levels of the rate-limiting enzyme in ceramide biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (SPT2) were measured, in addition to lipid analysis. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and ANOVA were used to assess the association between outcomes and groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Palmitate alone induced an increase in serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (SPT2) expression and an elevation of ceramide levels in myotubes. Co-incubation with palmitate and AICAR prevented both effects. However, ceramide and SPT2 increased with the addition of compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. In rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD), soleus SPT2 expression increased compared with normal chow-fed littermates. Moreover, rats on HFD that received daily AICAR injections had lower SPT2 levels and reduced muscle ceramide content compared with those on HFD only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that AICAR reduces ceramide synthesis by targeting SPT2 transcription, likely via AMPK activation as AMPK inhibition prevented the AICAR-induced improvements. Given the role of skeletal muscle ceramide in insulin resistance, it is tempting to speculate that interventions that activate AMPK may lead to long-term ceramide reduction and improved metabolic function.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AICAR</kwd><kwd>Ceramide</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Metabolic syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Obesity predisposes individuals to a host of health complications, including insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which characterize the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Due to the massive and sustained increase in obesity and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome worldwide in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], extensive efforts have been devoted to better understand the cellular events that mediate obesity-related pathologies.</p><p>Long known to regulate apoptotic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the biologically active sphingolipid ceramide is more recently known to mediate several of the deleterious conditions associated with obesity, such as insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A variety of stimuli have been found to induce ceramide biosynthesis in rodents, including high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and inflammatory agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Despite the wealth of research establishing the efficacy of ceramide inhibition in improving obesity-related morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], no current prescribed pharmacological therapies are known to directly inhibit ceramide biosynthesis. A potentially useful focus in exploring treatments to prevent excessive ceramide accumulation, and block ceramide-mediated pathologies related to obesity, is to identify anti-ceramide effects of currently used drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A promising possibility is to explore the numerous drugs prescribed to treat obesity-related diseases that are known to regulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).</p><p>Research in recent decades has elucidated the role of the prototypical metabolic regulator AMPK in ameliorating deleterious conditions associated with obesity. Indeed, AMPK-activating drugs have been shown to improve insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which may explain their widespread use. Interestingly, many of the benefits attributed to AMPK activation are similar to those seen with ceramide inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The metabolic functions of AMPK are increasingly clear&#x02014;increased glucose uptake, increased fatty acid uptake and oxidation, and the inhibition of anabolic processes (e.g., lipogenesis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We have previously shown that AMPK inhibits inflammatory activity by blocking the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which, in light of our recent observation that ceramide biosynthesis requires inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], suggests a potential ceramide-specific effect of AMPK activation. Given the general oxidative effect of AMPK on fatty acids, we sought to test the hypothesis that AMPK inhibits ceramide biosynthesis in muscle. Positive results will reveal a novel mechanism to partly explain the beneficial effects of AMPK-activating drugs in treating several obesity-related pathologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cells were maintained in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

During this time, rats were randomly sorted into one of four groups: no intervention (control diet; 8604 Harlan Teklad) (n=9), daily AICAR injections (n=9), high-fat diet (HFD) (n=11), or HFD with daily AICAR injections (n=10). The HFD used in this study was composed of the following (g/kg of food): 116.6 g olive oil, 232.7 g flax seed oil, 87.2 g sugar, 174.6 starch, 226.6 g casein, 4.5 g methionine, 30.7 g gelatin, 51.2 g wheat bran, 22.5 g vitamin mix (Harlan Teklad, AIN76A), 52.2. g mineral mix (Harlan Teklad, AIN76), 1.4 g choline chloride. The HFD was 60% fat (40% flax seed, 20% olive oil). AICAR injections (dissolved in 0.9% NaCl) were administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.5 mg/g body weight each morning. To reduce confounding factors, rats in the control and HFD groups were similarly handled each morning and injected with similar volumes of saline alone. All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by and performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Brigham Young University.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid analysis</title><p>For isolation of lipids, cell and tissue pellets were re-suspended in 900 &#x003bc;l ice-cold chloroform:methanol (1:2) and incubated for 15 min on ice then briefly vortexed.

Separation of aqueous and organic phases required addition of 400 &#x003bc;l of ice-cold water and 300 &#x003bc;l of ice-cold chloroform. The organic phase was collected into a fresh vial and lipids were dried under a gentle nitrogen stream. An Agilent high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled with an Applied Biosystems Triple Quadrupole/Ion Trap mass spectrometer (3200 Qtrap) was used for quantification of individual phospholipids.

Based on these observations, we anticipated a general reduction in accumulated intracellular lipids when cells were treated with palmitate and AICAR when compared with palmitate treatment alone. AICAR is a well-established AMPK activator. We found that levels of the glycerolipids triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B, respectively) were significantly increased in C2C12 myotubes in response to prolonged palmitate treatment. AICAR addition to palmitate incubations had no significant effect on TAG and DAG levels. Similar to these glycerolipids, palmitate induced a robust increase in ceramides and glucosylceramides (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D, respectively), which have both been implicated in mediating lipid-induced insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, whereas AICAR treatment had little effect of TAG and DAG, AICAR treatment blunted ceramide and glucosylceramides accrual to such a degree that levels returned to vehicle-treated conditions (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D). Despite its well-established ability to activate AMPK, AICAR may have off-target effects. To more confidently establish the importance of AMPK in mediating the sphingolipid-specific effects of AICAR, we included compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor. The addition of compound C to palmitate and AICAR treatments completely reversed the protective effect of AICAR with ceramides (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) and glucosylceramides (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Palmitate-induced sphingolipid accumulation is prevented with AICAR. </bold>C2C12 myotubes were incubated with palmitate (PA) for 16 h at 0.75 mM.

Our data suggest that AICAR treatment, which is known to potently activate AMPK, inhibits ceramide accumulation in lipid-laden conditions by inhibiting lipid-induced expression of the rate-limiting enzyme SPT2. These findings were particularly robust in murine myotubes, which showed a dramatic increase in SPT2 expression and ceramides with palmitate exposure and a complete reversal of both trends with AICAR inclusion. Additionally, and suggestive of the importance of AMPK, the addition of the AMPK inhibitor compound C increased transcript levels of SPT2 (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and both sphingolipids (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D). Less dramatic were the data from muscle from HFD-fed and AICAR-treated rats. While SPT2 expression was increased in muscle from HFD-fed rats compared with those receiving normal chow and decreased in the muscle of rats receiving AICAR injection in conjunction with HFD, actual ceramides only significantly differed between the HFD and HFD plus AICAR groups, nonetheless suggesting an <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of AICAR on ceramide inhibition (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>A likely explanation for the lack of a more robust increase in muscle ceramides in the HFD-fed group is the saturation state of the lipids in the HFD. Previous studies that have shown increased muscle ceramide in HFD-fed models have used a HFD that is largely lard based and is, subsequently, much higher in saturated fats than the HFD used in this study, which was almost completely unsaturated (flax and olive oil). Saturated fat is not only a substrate for ceramide, but it also activates the biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while unsaturated fats, particularly the mono-unsaturated oleic acid, do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast to the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, our use of palmitate in the cell culture provided a strong induction of ceramide biosynthesis. While the concentration used is not physiological (0.75 mM), it is widely used as a method to potently activate ceramide biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>Our findings of an anti-ceramide effect of AICAR in skeletal muscle corroborate previous observations in non-muscle tissues. Blazquez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] found that long-term stimulation of AMPK via AICAR treatment in astrocytes inhibited SPT activity and reduced ceramides. Collectively, these data highlight a novel specificity of AMPK activation to target ceramide synthesis in various cell types. Further, a possible mechanism for AMPK-induced inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis is the anti-inflammatory effects of AMPK. We recently found that ceramide biosynthesis requires NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which is inhibited by AMPK. Cacicedo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] observed that active AMPK prevents the inflammatory effects of both saturated fatty acids (SFA) and TNF&#x003b1; in endothelial cells. In particular, they found that the SFA- and TNF&#x003b1;-induced 2- to 4-fold increase in NF-&#x003ba;B reporter gene expression was prevented with both AICAR treatment and constitutively active AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Many prominent AMPK-activating drugs like metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZD) possess anti-inflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, given previous findings, it is not surprising that both metformin and TZD reduce ceramide accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], though whether the activation of AMPK is necessary for the drugs&#x02019; anti-inflammatory and anti-ceramide actions is unknown.</p><p>Previous studies have tangentially explored the relationship between AMPK and ceramides in skeletal muscle. Holland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] found that adiponectin, long known to improve insulin sensitivity and activate AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], potently stimulates ceramide conversion to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which opposes several of ceramide&#x02019;s deleterious effects in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, S1P induces AMPK activation, which explains the observation by Holland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] that ceramide activates AMPK in muscle cells. Given our findings that AMPK inhibits ceramide biosynthesis in muscle, these studies collectively suggest a self-regulating mechanism, wherein ceramide is converted to S1P, which activates AMPK and, in turn, inhibits ceramide biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, these experiments reveal that the AMPK activator AICAR reduces expression of SPT2 in skeletal muscle and prevents ceramide biosynthesis in hyperlipidemic conditions. Given the wide range of AMPK-activating drugs currently used to mitigate obesity-induced pathologies, our findings suggest that ceramide inhibition may be an important and novel mechanism that mediates several health benefits derived from AMPK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KAE and MES assisted with cell treatments, RT-qPCR, lipid extraction, and manuscript preparation.
