Here, we aimed to confirm whether Girdin is a target gene of miR-101 and determine the tumor suppressor of miR-101 through Girdin pathway. In our previous studies, we firstly found Girdin protein was overexpressed in HCC tissues, and it closely correlated to tumor size, T stage, TNM stage and Edmondson-Steiner stage of HCC patients. After specific small interfering RNA of Girdin was transfected into HepG2 and Huh7.5.1 cells, the proliferation and invasion ability of tumor cells were significantly inhibited. In this study, we further explored the detailed molecular mechanism of Girdin in HCC. Interestingly, we found that miR-101 significantly low-expressed in HCC tissues compared with that in matched normal tissues while Girdin had a relative higher expression, and miR-101 was inversely correlated with Girdin expression. In addition, after miR-101 transfection, the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells were weakened. Furthermore, we confirmed that Girdin is a direct target gene of miR-101. Finally we confirmed Talen-mediated Girdin knockout markedly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC while down-regulation of miR-101 significantly restored the inhibitory effect. Our findings suggested that miR-101/Girdin axis could be a potential application of HCC treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Girdin</kwd><kwd>invasion and metastasis</kwd><kwd>miR-101</kwd><kwd>primary hepatocellular carcinoma cell</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to 2012 American cancer statistics, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor with an increasing incidence (<xref rid="b11-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>). HCC is difficult to diagnose as early-stage disease, resulting in poor survival. In recent years, great advances have been made in diagnostic techniques and treatment of HCC, yet the overall survival of patients is still relatively low (<xref rid="b16-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Tameda et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC is expecting for further research.</p><p>MicroRNAs are conserved non-coding RNAs with the length of 19&#x02013;25nt, which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref rid="b6-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b10-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b18-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The abnormal miRNA expression has been reported in many kinds of cancer, whereby miRNA plays act as either tumor suppressor or promoter (<xref rid="b7-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Landgraf et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that a series of miRNAs are played crucial roles in HCC progression. MiR-195 has been proved to function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting CBX4 in HCC (<xref rid="b22-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). However, miR-21 acts as promoter for tumor metastasis in HCC (<xref rid="b23-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These miRNAs can be used as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for HCC. The above research findings highlight the importance of miRNAs in the oncobiological behavior, but their specific molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Girdin protein was discovered in 2005 and according to its functions was named as girders of actin filaments, Akt phosphorylated enhancer, Hook-related protein 1 and transport vesicle-related G&#x003b1; binding protein, respectively (<xref rid="b1-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Anai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b4-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b8-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b14-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>). Human Girdin protein was encoded through coiled-coil domain containing 88A (CCDC88A) gene that is located on chromosome 2p16.1. Numerous studies have shown that Girdin is highly expressed in many styles of tumor tissues, including gastric cancer (<xref rid="b17-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), esophageal cancer (<xref rid="b13-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Shibata et al., 2013</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b21-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref rid="b5-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). In our previous researches, high expression level of Girdin was found in HCC tissues and it closely correlated to tumor size, T stage, TNM stage and Edmondson-Steiner stage of HCC patients. After specific small interfering RNA of Girdin was transfected into HepG2 and Huh7.5.1 cells, the proliferation and invasion ability of tumor cells were significantly inhibited (<xref rid="b3-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2015</xref>). However, the concrete mechanisms of Girdin on proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC remain to be elucidated.</p><p>According to multiple microRNA target gene prediction software packages, such as TargetScan and miRanda, Girdin mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR is highly predicted to be a target gene of miR-101. Based on these findings, we have proposed the hypothesis that miR-101 inhibits HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by directly regulating Girdin.</p><p>In this study, we found that miR-101 expression in the HCC tissue was significantly downregulated compared with that in the para-cancer tissue while Girdin mRNA expression in HCC tissue was upregulatied compared with that in the para-cancer tissue. Upon miR-101 transfection, the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells were weakened. In addition, the dual luciferase assay confirmed that Girdin is the direct target gene of miR-101. Finally we confirmed Talen-mediated Girdin knockout remarkably suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities in HCC while down-regulation of miR-101 significantly restored the inhibitory effect. Thus, miR-101/Girdin axis may be a promising molecular target for HCC therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue samples and cell lines</title><p>Forty-five cases of specimens of HCCs and the para-cancer tissues (the distance between the tissue and cancer tissue was &#x02265;2 cm) were selected from Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. All patients had signed informed consent forms and the study had received approval from Xiangya Hospital Ethics Committee. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell strain HepG2 (ATCC, USA) was purchased from Cell Biology Laboratory, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University. HepG2 cells were cultured in a medium containing DMEM and 10% FBS in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>The Girdin amplification primer sequence was downloaded from NCBI and Primer5.0 software was used to design primers. The primer sequences of Girdin were as follows: forward 5&#x02032;-GACCAACTAGAGGGAACTCG-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-TACTTTGT TTCTGTGCCATT-3&#x02032;. The primer sequences of &#x003b2;-actin sense strand was: AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT and the anti-sense strand was: GGCGGCACCACCA TGTACCCT. Both miR-101 (HmiRQP0020) and U6 (HmiRQP9001) primers were purchased from Guangzhou Fulengen Co., Ltd. (China). TRIzol method (Invitrogen) was used to extract the total RNA of cells and tissues. The purity and integrity of RNA was examined on a Micro-UV Spectrophotometer and RNA electrophoresis. Total RNAs was reverse- transcribed into cDNA with miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, USA) on an ABI-9600 PCR Amplifier (PerkinElmer) detected by ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer). Samples were compared by using the relative expression level was calculated via the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup> method. Girdin mRNA expression level was normalized to &#x003b2;-actin, while miR-101 expression level was normalized to U6.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell transfection</title><p>miR-101 mimics, miR-101 inhibitor and miRNA NC mimics were purchased from Guangzhou Fulengen Co., Ltd. (China). Talen kit was purchased from SiDanSai Company (China). The HepG2 cells were inoculated into the 60mm cell culture dish (5 ml/well) by density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>cells/ml. When the cells reached 80% confluence, Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect miR-101 mimics, miR-101 inhibitor and miRNA NC mimics into HepG2 cells according to the instructions, respectively. According to the method reported by literatures, plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells in order to perform the knockout of the Girdin gene (<xref rid="b2-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). 48h after transfection, the fluorescence microscopy and the qRT-PCR were used to detect whether the cell cloning process was successful.</p></sec><sec><title>CCK-8 test</title><p>48 h after transfection, the cells were inoculated to a 96-well plate by 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells for each well. Five repeated wells were set in each group. Cells were cultured for 24, 48, 72 h, respectively, and CCK-8 was added to each well for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C. ELIASA was used to detect absorbency value at a wavelength of 450 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Scratch test and Transwell test</title><p>The 48 h after transfection, the cells were inoculated to a 24-well plate by 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. When the cells covered the well bottom, the 10&#x003bc;L tip was used to scratch the cell monolayer. And a serum-free medium was used to wash it twice. Images were captured at different time points (0 and 24 h) by microscopy to assess the rate of gap closure. Scratch healing rate = (scratch width at 0 time point &#x02212; scratch width at 24 time points)/scratch width at hour 0 time point &#x000d7; 100%.</p><p>The Transwell chamber was placed in a 24-well culture plate. A 500 &#x003bc;l preheated serum-free medium was added into the invasion chamber. After transfection, the density of HepG2 cells was adjusted to 5 &#x000d7; 105 cells/ml with a serum-free medium. A 100 &#x003bc;l cell suspension was added into each upper chamber, and a 500 &#x003bc;l medium containing 10% FBS was added into the lower chamber. After 24 h, cotton swabs were used to wipe cells on the upper surface, while cells attached to the membranes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with hematoxylin. The results of the Transwell assay were imaged and the number of invasive cells was evaluated by the OD value.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>The 48 h after transfection, the cellular protein was extracted. After the protein concentration was measured via the BCA method, 5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel were performed SDS-PAGE electrophoreses. After that, the substances were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Rabbit anti-human Girdin polyclonal primary antibody (SC-133371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and kept in a shaker at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (111-035-003, Jackson) was added for incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. X-ray film was exposed, developed and fixed. The incubation and coloring of &#x003b2;-actin internal reference antibody were the same as the above mentioned methods, and the primary antibody and secondary antibodies used were mouse anti-human &#x003b2;-actin monoclonal antibody (BM0272, ABZOOM) and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (111-035-008, Jackson), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Dual luciferase assay</title><p>psiCHECKTM-2 vector (Promega) was purchased from Aura-gene Bioscience Corporation Inc. (China). miR-101 binds to two sites of Girdin-3&#x02032;UTR, the vectors of the two sites were built, respectively, which were named UTR-1 and UTR-2. Two restriction endonucleases, <italic>Xho</italic>l and <italic>Not</italic>I, were used to clone the target gene fragment into the vectors. The primer sequences of Girdin-3&#x02032;UTR and mutant Girdin-3&#x02032;UTR are shown below. When the confluence of cells reached 50-60% in the 24-well plate, a 0.5 &#x003bc;g reporter gene plasmid and miR-101 mimics and miRNA NC mimics were co-transfected into HepG2 cells. The 48 h after transfection, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System E1910 (Promega, USA) was used to detect the activities of firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase in each group, and ratio of renilla luciferase activity/firefly luciferase activity (R/F) was used as the relative activity value.</p><p>Girdin-3&#x02032;-UTR gene sequence was downloaded from NCBI.

The results showed that knockout of Girdin expression also remarkably suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells while down-regulation of miR-101 significantly restored the inhibitory effect, suggesting that miR-101 suppressed HCC development by mainly targeting Girdin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In recent years, increasing evidence suggests that the dysregulation of miRNAs participates in many types of cancer and the abnormal expression of miR-101 is closely related to the progression of many tumors. <xref rid="b20-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2013)</xref> confirmed that miR-101 inhibits angiogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma by directly regulating the VEGF mRNA. Another study found that miR-101 suppresses the proliferation of thyroid papillary cancer cells through targeting Rac1 (<xref rid="b9-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). However, miR-101 also has been reported to increase pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell sensitivity to cisplatin by activating caspase 3-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="b19-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). The functions of miR-101 in HCC also have attracted an increasing amount of attention. <xref rid="b15-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. (2009)</xref> examined the expression levels of 308 kinds of miRNA in HCC tissue and found that miR-101 expression in HCC tissue was significantly lower. miR-101 exerts pro-apoptotic function through its target Mcl-1 in HCC (<xref rid="b15-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2009</xref>). However, the specific molecular mechanism of miR-101 in HCC remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, miR-101 expression level in HCC tissue detected via qRT-PCR method. The results showed that the miR-101 level in HCC tissue was significantly lower than that in the para-cancer tissue and miR-101 level in stage III/IV was lower compared with that in stage I/II. Meanwhile, Girdin mRNA expression level in HCC tissue was significantly higher in HCC tissues and Girdin level in stage III/IV was also higher than that in stage I/II. This result verified the results previously reported in the literature. The correlation analysis was showed that a negative correlation between miR-101 and Girdin expression levels.</p><p>To further explore the effect of miR-101 in <italic>vitro</italic>, we overex-pressed miR-101 in HepG2 cells. The cell proliferation assays revealed that miR-101 suppresses proliferation of HepG2 cells. The scratch and Transwell analysis revealed that miR-101 inhibits cell migration and invasion abilities. These results demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-101 expression can effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells. The aforementioned results were consistent with the previously study results (<xref rid="b12-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b15-molce-39-2-96" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, the relationship between miR-101 and Girdin has not been reported. To further verify whether Girdin is the target gene of miR-101, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression of Girdin in HepG2 cells. We found that Girdin mRNA and its protein expression levels were significantly decreased after miR-101 mimics were transfected into the HepG2 cell. The dual luciferase gene analysis confirmed that miR-101 could directly bind to Girdin mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR. Therefore, Girdin is the target gene of miR-101 in HCC.</p><p>In this study, Tanlen technology was used to perform the knockout of Girdin. After co-transfected with Talen plasmids and miR-101 inhibitor, CCK-8 test, scratch test and Transwell test were used to further verify tumor promotion effect of Girdin. The results showed that after knockout of Girdin limited proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cell, yet downregulation miR-101 significantly recovered this inhibitory effect, suggesting that miR-101 suppressed HCC development by mainly targeting Girdin.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrated that miR-101 expression is dramatically decreased in HCC tissues compared with that in matched normal tissues. Upregulation of miR-101 remarkably inhibits HepG2 cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities. As a target gene of miR-101, knockout of Girdin also suppressed HepG2 cell proliferation, migration and invasion while down-regulation of miR-101 significantly restored the inhibitory effect. Therefore, the miR-101/Girdin pathway may provide a new direction for the clinical treatment of HCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title/><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="molce-39-2-96-supple.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e541" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81572965, 81372140, 81301688, 81272192, 81171882), Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 20130162110050 and 20130162120093), Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-11-0527), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M552167), Post-doctoral Foundation of Central South University (No. 131425), Project of the Department of Science and Technology of Hunan Province (No. 2013FJ6003), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (2015zzts277), 125 Talent Project of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>Note: Supplementary information is available on the Molecules and Cells website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.molcells.org">www.molcells.org</ext-link>).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-molce-39-2-96"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anai</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Shojima</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Katagiri</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogihara</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakoda</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Onishi</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ono</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujishiro</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fukushima</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Horike</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>A novel protein kinase b (pkb)/akt-binding protein enhances pkb kinase activity and regulates DNA synthesis</article-title><source>J.
