We have examined the spatial and functional  relationship between the sites of heat shock gene transcription and the speckles enriched in splicing factors in  primary human fibroblasts by combining immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  The hsp90&#x003b1; and hsp70 genes are inducibly regulated by  exposure to stress from a low basal level to a high rate  of transcription; additionally the hsp90&#x003b1; gene contains  10 introns whereas the hsp70 gene is intronless. At  37&#x000b0;C, only 30% of hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites are associated with speckles whereas little association is detected  with the hsp70 gene, whose constitutive expression is  undetectable relative to the hsp90&#x003b1; gene. Upon exposure of cells to heat shock, the heavy metal cadmium, or  the amino acid analogue azetidine, transcription at the  hsp90&#x003b1; and hsp70 gene loci is strongly induced, and  both hsp transcription sites become associated with  speckles in &#x0003e;90% of the cells. These results reveal a  clear disconnection between the presence of intervening sequences at specific gene loci and the association  with splicing factor&#x02013;rich regions and suggest that subnuclear structures containing splicing factors are associated with sites of transcription.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heat shock genes</kwd><kwd>nuclear organization</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>U<sc>nderstanding</sc> the spatial relationship between  nuclear architecture and genomic function represents a major objective of cell biology. Discrete  subnuclear sites for transcription and splicing have been  described; however, the structure/function relationships of  these organized structures remain unresolved. For example, several studies using labeled precursors for RNA synthesis have shown that the sites of RNA polymerase II  (Pol II)<sup>1</sup> transcription are widely distributed in the nucleus  (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fakan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Moen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Clemson  and Lawrence, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Huang and Spector, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Misteli  and Spector, 1998</xref>). Similarly, active Pol II has been found  randomly distributed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Garcia and  Spector, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>), thus suggesting that transcription occurs at multiple sites throughout the nucleus.  However, other studies using different reagents have  shown that a subpopulation of the active Pol II is concentrated in specific nuclear regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Thibodeau and Vincent,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bregman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Blencowe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Mortillaro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Patturajan et al., 1998</xref>). A recent study  by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wei et al. (1998)</xref> has shown that individual Pol II transcription sites, detected by BrUTP incorporation, are spatially segregated in the nucleus into &#x0223c;16 higher order domains, providing support for the compartmentalization of  RNA Pol II transcription within a discrete number of nuclear factories. Consistent with the organization of the  transcription sites into domains, total poly(A) RNAs detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) appear  to concentrate in 20&#x02013;40 nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Carter et al., 1991</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1993</xref>).</p><p>The small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and  various non-snRNP splicing factors such as SC35, U2AF,  U2B&#x02033;, or SF2/ASF detected by immunofluorescence distribute in the nucleus in 20&#x02013;40 foci of varying size termed  &#x0201c;speckles,&#x0201d; in addition to a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining  of lesser intensity (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Moen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Clemson and Lawrence, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Huang and Spector, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Misteli and Spector, 1998</xref>).  Three classes of nuclear structures enriched in splicing factors have been described by electron microscopy (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fakan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Puvion and Puvion-Dutilleul,  1996</xref>): (a) the interchromatin granules (IGs), which correspond to the speckles described by immunofluorescence  and represent compact structures containing high concentrations of both snRNPs and non-snRNPs splicing factors;  (b) the perichromatin fibrils (PFs), which are less concentrated in splicing factors and may correspond to the diffuse  nucleoplasmic staining; and (c) the coiled bodies (CBs),  which are compact structures highly enriched in snRNPs  but devoid of the essential splicing factor SC35 (for review  see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Matera, 1998</xref>).</p><p>To what extent do nuclear domains enriched in RNA  Pol II or splicing factors reflect gene expression, sites of  storage, and assembly of macromolecular structures, or recycling centers? In contrast to available methodologies  which have demonstrated the presence of organizing sites  of transcription, it has been difficult to establish the relationship between structure and function for RNA splicing,  specifically to discriminate between actively engaged and  inert splicing complexes. Based on in vitro and in vivo evidence that intron excision is spatially and temporally associated with transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang and Spector, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Raap  et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Xing et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Wuarin and Schibler, 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>), an indirect measure of the role of these  different nuclear structures in transcription and splicing  has thus been to analyze the relative distribution of splicing factors and active sites of transcription. Electron microscopic studies have shown that sites of [<sup>3</sup>H]uridine incorporation occur preferentially in the vicinity of PFs (for  review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fakan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Puvion and Puvion-Dutilleul,  1996</xref>). Similarly, sites of transcription detected by BrUTP  incorporation reveal little colocalization with the nuclear  speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Wansink et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Pombo and Cook, 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fay et al., 1997</xref>), and active RNA Pol II is distributed randomly relative to the speckles enriched in splicing factors  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, several viral and endogenous  transcription sites detected by FISH display little or no association relative to the speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lampel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Altogether, these  observations suggest that transcription by RNA Pol II and  splicing would occur in domains scattered throughout the  nucleus but distinct from SC35/snRNP-rich speckles.</p><p>In contrast, others have shown that the 20&#x02013;40 foci enriched in poly(A) RNA colocalize with speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Carter et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Visa et al., 1993</xref>). In addition, several specific transcription sites detected by FISH have  been shown to be spatially associated with these regions  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang and Spector, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1996a</xref>,b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Wang et al., 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Xing et al., 1993</xref>), and a study of  five endogenous genes has shown that inactive genes are  randomly distributed relative to the speckles enriched in  splicing factors, whereas active genes were closely associated with these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Xing et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, the  cytomegalovirus immediate early gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Dirks et  al., 1997</xref>) as well as the stably transfected homeobox gene  pem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Misteli et al., 1998</xref>) are found associated with nuclear speckles only when they are actively transcribed,  thus providing support for a role of the speckles in transcription and splicing.</p><p>Three models for the role of speckles in transcription  and splicing have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Clemson and Lawrence,  1996</xref>): (a) speckles represent sites of storage and/or assembly-disassembly of splicing factors; (b) speckles are often  associated with pre-mRNA metabolism of specific genes;  and (c) speckles represent distinct functional entities with  some representing storage sites and corresponding to the  IGs, while others associated with active genes would represent sites of transcription and splicing and more likely  correspond to large accumulations of PFs. In agreement  with the latter model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Huang and Spector (1996a)</xref> have  proposed that upon activation of RNA Pol II transcription, splicing factors would be recruited from their sites  of storage and/or reassembly, the IGs, to the sites of  transcription where nascent transcripts would be spliced.  When the transcription rate is very high, a substantial  amount of splicing factors would be recruited to the sites  of transcription, resulting in a granular IG-like appearance  which would be functionally distinct from IGs. This assumption can explain the colocalization observed between  several specific transcripts and the speckles. Consistent  with this proposal, the splicing factor SF2/ASF fused to the  green fluorescent protein is recruited to new sites of viral  transcription upon transcriptional activation in living cells,  thus demonstrating that one function of the speckles is to  supply splicing factors to neighboring active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Misteli  et al., 1997</xref>). The recruitment of splicing factors to the sites  of transcription can be intron-dependent as demonstrated  by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Huang and Spector (1996b)</xref> using a set of intron-containing and intronless constructs. However, a caveat of  these studies is that the genes which were studied were either integrated viral genomes or transfected constructs.</p><p>To address key issues concerning the involvement of the  nuclear speckles in transcription and splicing activities, we  used a combination of FISH and immunofluorescence to  examine whether the speckles are associated with sites  of transcription of a class of coregulated cellular heat  shock genes including members which are intron-containing (hsp90&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hickey et al., 1986</xref>) and intronless (hsp70)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Wu et al., 1985</xref>), and whose expression can be inducibly  regulated (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Morimoto, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Morimoto et  al., 1996</xref>). This system allows the examination of both the  dynamics of transcription of well studied cellular genes  and the role of introns in association with the speckles.  Our results reveal that both hsp90&#x003b1; and hsp70 transcription sites associate with the speckles upon stress-induced  transcriptional activation, independent of the presence of  introns.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Stress Induction</title><p>Human normal primary fibroblasts were obtained from a skin biopsy performed on a healthy female donor.

Our rationale for selection of the hsp90&#x003b1; and  hsp70 genes was based on three criteria: (a) both genes are  transcribed at a low basal rate in cells at normal growth  temperatures; (b) the transcription rates of both genes are  induced to high levels upon exposure to heat shock and  other stresses; and (c) the hsp90&#x003b1; gene contains 10 introns  whereas the hsp70 gene is intronless. The relative distribution of hsp70 or hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites and SC35 splicing factor was analyzed by using a procedure combining  immunofluorescence for the detection of splicing factors  and FISH for the detection of hsp nuclear transcripts  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Jolly et al., 1997a</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated previously that hsp70 and hsp90&#x003b1; gene expression is induced by heat shock and other  stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Watowich and Morimoto, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abravaya et al.,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Morimoto et al., 1996</xref>).  At 37&#x000b0;C, hsp90&#x003b1; transcripts are constitutively detected  whereas hsp70 mRNAs were undetectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, lane  a). This corresponded, by transcriptional run-on analysis,  to a very low basal rate of hsp90&#x003b1; gene transcription at  37&#x000b0;C while hsp70 gene transcription was repressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>  b, lane a). Within the nucleus of diploid fibroblasts, hsp  transcripts detected by FISH appear as two foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).  Because hsp90&#x003b1; transcription rate is low, the foci detected  by FISH may correspond partially to nascent transcripts  which are retained at the site of transcription, as has been  shown for hsp70 transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Jolly et al., 1998</xref>). Codetection of the transcripts and the corresponding gene by  FISH showed a complete overlap of the two hybridization  signals at the level of light microscopy (data not shown).  For the hsp70 gene whose constitutive expression is too  low (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we chose to detect the gene itself by FISH.  </p><p>In control cells, SC35 speckles were associated with 30%  of the hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites, averaging over 200 transcription sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> a and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). In contrast, only 10%  of the signals corresponding to the hsp70 gene were associated with SC35 speckles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b). No differences in the  size or intensity of associated versus nonassociated transcription sites were observed. Nuclear speckles were found  by quantitative digital imaging analyses to occupy 5&#x02013;17%  of the nuclear volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang and Spector, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Carter  et al., 1993</xref>) whereas hsp transcripts occupy &#x0003c;1% of the  nuclear volume. The low percentage of association between SC35 speckles and hsp70 transcription sites consequently reflects random distribution, whereas the 30% association with hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites is significant and  likely reflects the higher basal transcription rate of the  hsp90&#x003b1; gene. </p></sec><sec><title>Relative Distribution of SC35 Speckles and hsp Genes  in Heat-shocked Cells</title><p>To address whether the distribution of SC35 speckles and  hsp genes is a reflection of introns or of the transcription  rate, we exposed the cells to a heat shock at 42&#x000b0;C or 45&#x000b0;C,  conditions which result in a dramatic elevation of heat  shock gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Watowich and Morimoto, 1988</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abravaya et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; for review see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Morimoto et al., 1996</xref>). The analysis of hsp90&#x003b1; and hsp70  gene transcription rates, by nuclear run-on analysis, revealed that both genes were induced strongly following a  42&#x000b0;C or 45&#x000b0;C heat shock (5- and 12-fold induction for the  hsp90&#x003b1; gene, and 14- and 35-fold induction for the hsp70  gene at 42&#x000b0;C and 45&#x000b0;C, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b). Quantification of the mRNA levels by RT-PCR revealed a 11.4-fold  (42&#x000b0;C) and 29.7-fold (45&#x000b0;C) induction of hsp70 mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, lanes b and c) and a 1.5-fold (42&#x000b0;C) and 2.5-fold (45&#x000b0;C) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, lanes b and c) induction of hsp90&#x003b1;  mRNA. As expected, the fold-induction of hsp90&#x003b1; transcripts determined by measuring mRNA levels was lower  than for hsp70 due to the higher basal levels of hsp90&#x003b1;  transcripts in control cells.</p><p>hsp70 or hsp90&#x003b1; transcripts were detected together with  the SC35 splicing factors in heat-shocked cells. As shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, 92% of hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites were observed  to be adjacent to SC35 speckles in the 42&#x000b0;C treated cells  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a) and 94% in the 45&#x000b0;C treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> c). Likewise, 92% and 93% of the chromosomal sites of hsp70  transcription were associated with a SC35 speckle in cells  exposed to 42&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b) and to 45&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> d), respectively. Identical results were obtained in cells exposed at  42&#x000b0;C or 45&#x000b0;C for only 10 min (data not shown), attesting  that the association of splicing factors with transcribing  genes is a very rapid process, directly correlated to the  transcriptional activity of the gene and not due to major  rearrangements of the nuclear architecture as a consequence of heat shock. </p><p>The high degree of spatial coincidence between SC35  speckles and sites of hsp gene transcription following activation of the heat shock response reveals that a key feature of recruitment of SC35 splicing factors relates to the  dynamics of transcription. A similar spatial association of  the heat-activated hsp90&#x003b2; gene with the speckles has been  reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lampel et al., 1997</xref>). Our results  demonstrate, however, that the splicing factors do not distinguish between intron-containing and intronless genes.  Activated hsp genes were not found to be preferentially  associated with larger speckles as has been observed for fibronectin transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">1995</xref>), perhaps reflecting a gene specificity in the pattern of association with  the speckles.</p><p>To what extent do our observations reflect features of  SC35 which are not general to splicing complexes? To ensure that our results were not limited to the SC35 splicing  factor or due to the fact that the anti-SC35 antibody only  recognizes a phosphoepitope of the protein, we performed  the same experiments on control and heat-shocked cells  with the Y12 antibody to detect snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Lerner et al.,  1981</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) or with an anti-U2B&#x02032;&#x02032;antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Mattaj  et al., 1986</xref>) (data not shown). The results obtained for  both antibodies revealed the association of both hsp70  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites (data not shown)  with the speckles only in cells exposed to 42&#x000b0;C. </p></sec><sec><title>Other Stresses Also Induce a Tight Association of  Active hsp Genes with SC35 Speckles</title><p>To exclude that the redistribution of splicing factors following heat shock was due solely to the effects of elevated  temperatures on nuclear organization, heat shock gene  transcription was activated by exposure to azetidine or  cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mosser et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Williams and Morimoto,  1990</xref>). Both treatments resulted in an increase in hsp70  and hsp90&#x003b1; mRNA levels comparable to those induced by  a 42&#x000b0;C heat shock (i.e., a 10.9- and 12.1-fold increase in  hsp70 mRNA levels, and a 1.4- and 1.5-fold increase in  hsp90&#x003b1; mRNA levels in azetidine- and cadmium-treated  cells, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, lanes d and e). This was corroborated by transcriptional run-on assay showing that  both genes were actively induced in cadmium- and azetidine-treated cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,  94% and 95% of the hsp90&#x003b1; transcripts were associated  with SC35 speckles in azetidine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a) and cadmium-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> c), respectively. Similarly, 90% of the  hsp70 transcription sites were associated with SC35 speckles in azetidine-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b) and 93% in cadmium-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> d). These observations confirm  and extend the results of the heat-induced association of  hsp70 and hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites with the speckles, and  demonstrate that the dynamic relocalization of splicing  factors is not caused by the thermal effects of heat shock  but is primarily a reflection of the elevated rates of transcription of both gene loci. </p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Stress on the Transcription and Splicing  Activities of the Cells</title><p>Human primary fibroblasts are relatively resistant to heat  shock and display a very low percentage of cell death following a 1-h heat shock at 45&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Jolly et al., 1997b</xref>). In addition, general features of nuclear morphology visualized  by light microscopy do not appear to be altered by heat exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Jolly et al., 1997a</xref>). To address whether the different inducers of heat shock gene expression employed here  caused a transcriptional arrest, we monitored general transcriptional activity by visualizing the sites of BrUTP incorporation into nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Wansink et al., 1993</xref>). As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, there was no detectable change in the  transcriptional pattern in cells treated with either heat  shock, cadmium, or azetidine when compared to control  cells. </p><p>We next investigated the distribution of RNA Pol II for  its presence within the speckles and to determine whether  the various stress conditions influenced its distribution.  Since substantial variations in Pol II distribution depending on the cell type and the specific antibody used have  been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Thibodeau and Vincent, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Garcia and Spector, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bregman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Blencowe  et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Mortillaro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Patturajan et al., 1998</xref>), we used three characterized antibodies recognizing different epitopes on the RNA Pol II. As  previously reported for other cell types, the POL3/3 antibody, which recognizes an epitope outside of the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and is independent of  the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, shows a diffuse  nucleoplasmic staining at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al.,  1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kontermann et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, the CC-3 antibody, which recognizes a phosphoepitope in the CTD,  stains a subpopulation of Pol II concentrated in speckles  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Thibodeau and Vincent, 1991</xref>). The MARA3  antibody, which recognizes a phosphoepitope in the CTD  different from CC-3, stains both a diffuse population and a  subpopulation of the RNA Pol II concentrated in the  speckles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Patturajan et al., 1998</xref>). As previously  shown by others, these different patterns correspond to  different subpopulations of RNA Pol II. In our human primary fibroblasts, at least two distinct hyperphosphorylated  forms of RNA Pol II appear to concentrate in the speckles; however, whether these subpopulations represent active forms of the enzyme is still unknown. None of these  patterns were altered by a 42&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, d&#x02013;f) or 45&#x000b0;C heat  shock (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, g&#x02013;i), or by cadmium and azetidine treatments (data not shown). These observations showed that  in human fibroblasts at least a subpopulation of RNA Pol  II was localized to the speckles and that the overall distribution of the enzyme was not affected dramatically by  stress. </p><p>As RNA splicing is affected by heat shock in many organisms (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Jolly and Morimoto, 1999</xref>), we  chose to examine whether the differential distribution of  hsp genes relative to SC35 speckles during stress was a  consequence of a potential stress-induced arrest in RNA  splicing. In human cells, heat shock results in a redistribution of snRNPs from the speckles to a diffuse nucleoplasmic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Spector et al., 1991</xref>). It has also been shown  that extracts from HeLa cells heat-shocked at 43&#x000b0;C or  higher temperatures are unable to form a functional spliceosome; however, the putative factor(s) inactivated by  heat remains unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Shukla et al., 1990</xref>). To examine whether the association of hsp transcription sites with  speckles was due to a heat-induced retention of unprocessed hsp transcripts at the sites of transcription, we analyzed the transcripts of the two intron-containing hsp90&#x003b1;  and hsp90&#x003b2; genes from cells exposed to heat shock at 42&#x000b0;C  or 45&#x000b0;C, cadmium, or azetidine by RT-PCR using primers  surrounding an intron. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, the hsp90&#x003b1;  and hsp90&#x003b2; transcripts detected under all conditions corresponded only to the expected processed species with no  detection of the predicted precursor species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to investigate, in mammalian cells,  the relative distribution of splicing factors and endogenous  intronless or intron-containing genes with relation to their  inducible transcriptional activity. At 37&#x000b0;C the inactive  hsp70 gene was associated randomly relative to the distribution of nuclear SC35 speckles, whereas the hsp90&#x003b1; gene  was weakly associated with splicing speckles, consistent  with a low but detectable basal transcription. When the  cells were exposed to various stressors which resulted in  the inducible transcription of the hsp genes, both hsp70  and hsp90&#x003b1; genes became associated with the speckles.  The association of splicing factors with the new sites of  transcription is a rapid process, occuring immediately  upon gene activation. In addition, at least two subpopulations of hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol II were found to  concentrate in the speckles, and this distribution was unaffected by stress. Altogether our data demonstrate that the  association of specific genes with splicing factors is a reflection principally of the transcription rate of the endogenous cellular gene and does not depend upon the presence  of introns in the primary transcript. These observations  complement the recent findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al. (1999)</xref> that  some intron-containing pre-mRNAs are poorly associated  with increased concentrations of SC35, both demonstrating a disconnection between the presence of introns and  the spatial association with splicing factors.</p><sec><title>Is the Association with Splicing Speckles a Measure of  Active Gene Transcription?</title><p>An important conclusion of our results is that the association of splicing factors with the sites of transcription of endogenous genes is best indicated by the level of transcriptional activity. Under control conditions where heat shock  genes are either repressed or transcribed at low basal levels, they are randomly distributed in regards to splicing  factors or weakly associated with them, whereas upon  gene activation, splicing factors accumulate rapidly at the  sites of abundant nascent transcripts. The significance of  the 30% association of hsp90&#x003b1; transcription sites with the  speckles at 37&#x000b0;C is uncertain. Since we did not observe a  significant difference in the fluorescent intensity of associated versus nonassociated transcription sites, this may reflect variation in the relative rate of transcription at the  chromosomal loci. Alternatively, this could reflect variation in the local concentration of splicing factors and the  limitations of light microscopy. Finally, high concentrations  of splicing factors may not be required at the sites of transcription, which may at least in part correspond to sites  of accumulation of full-length mature nascent transcripts  rather than growing RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Jolly et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our results are in good agreement with several previous  studies, showing a redistribution of factors involved in  transcription, pre-mRNA processing, and RNA packaging  in response to changes in gene activity. Indeed, splicing  factors have been shown to relocalize in response to RNA  Pol II inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Carmo-Fonseca et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zeng et al.,  1997</xref>), to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Martin et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Garcia and Spector, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Spector et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Pombo et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Puvion-Dutilleul et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bridge et al., 1995</xref>), or  to inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">O'Keefe et al., 1994</xref>).  Moreover, the localization of splicing factors to Balbiani  ring genes occurs in a transcription-dependent manner in  the nuclei of <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baur&#x000e9;n et al., 1996</xref>), and  splicing factors are associated with the loops of lampbrush  chromosomes in amphibian germinal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Wu et al.,  1991</xref>). In human cells, several in situ studies have shown  that the nuclear speckles are associated predominantly  with transcriptionally active cellular and viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Xing et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Dirks et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Misteli et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1998</xref>).</p><p>Other observations, however, indicate that certain  highly spliced endogenous pre-mRNAs are poorly associated with increased concentrations of SC35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al.,  1999</xref>). Similarly, some viral transcripts display little or no  association with speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lampel et al.,  1997</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that transcription  is not sufficient for the association of specific genes with  nuclear speckles and reveal a more complex view of the  nuclear compartimentation of transcription and splicing  activities. The most likely hypothesis to integrate our observations in the context of other results is the existence of  a gene specificity and/or cell type specificity in the distribution of splicing factors regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Likewise since some active genes predominantly associate with  larger speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">1995</xref>), we can imagine  that other active genes preferentially associate with very  low amounts of splicing factors which can be missed due to  the limitations of microscopic resolution. The concentration of splicing factors associated with specific transcription sites may be gene-specific and may depend on the  combined effect of several factors such as the size and  complexity of the gene, its transcription rate, and its position in the nucleus and/or its chromosomal environment  which can impose structural constraints, thus limiting the  access of splicing factors to these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Moen et al.,  1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Xing et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Our work now  adds to this by demonstrating that the presence or absence  of introns is not a determining factor for the association of  active genes with splicing factor&#x02013;rich regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Nuclear Speckles in Transcription and Splicing</title><p>The functional significance of splicing factors organized  into subnuclear structures has been uncertain, although  much of the data in the literature are consistent with a role  of splicing factor complexes associated with the transcription and processing of intron-containing genes. The association of splicing factors with intron-dependent sites of  transcription was demonstrated in experiments transiently  or stably expressing intronless and intron-containing genes  in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Huang and Spector, 1996b</xref>). The recruitment of splicing factors to sites of transcription based on  a phosphorylation cycle which is tightly correlated with  splicing activity also supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Misteli et al.,  1998</xref>). Consequently, how do we incorporate the observations of the present study, that splicing factors can also be  associated with sites of transcription independent of introns?</p><p>In our analysis, we examined the sites of transcription of  endogenous cellular genes, in contrast to genes reintroduced by transfection or expressed following viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Huang and Spector, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Misteli et al., 1998</xref>). The  introduction of exogenous nucleic acids, by transfection,  could potentially influence aspects of nuclear organization  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>) with consequences on endogenous  transcriptional activities and a redistribution of splicing  factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Huang and Spector, 1996b</xref>). Likewise, the genomic site of integration in stably transfected constructs or  integrated viral genomes may also influence their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Al-Shawi et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>The association of the intronless hsp70 gene with speckles could be the result of the physical proximity on the  chromosome of a distinct, highly transcribed, intron-containing gene, although this seems unlikely given that our  data show a very high percentage of association between  hsp70 transcription sites and the speckles. In addition, this  association is strictly observed in stressed cells, suggesting  that the putative neighboring gene would need to be  stress-responsive. The only known hsp gene located in the  vicinity of the hsp70 gene, which is located in the 6p21.3  region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Harrison et al., 1987</xref>), is the hsp90&#x003b2; gene which  maps to the 6p12 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Durkin et al., 1993</xref>); the physical  distance between these two genes allows a clear discrimination between the two transcription sites by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Jolly et al., 1997c</xref>). Thus, the association observed  between the intronless hsp70 transcription sites and the  speckles is significant.</p><p>A more likely explanation for the different interpretations is that the distribution of transcription sites relative  to nuclear speckles varies in a gene-specific manner. Indeed, differential distributions of viral or endogenous  transcripts relative to nuclear speckles have been reported  already, and they may reflect differences in the organization of nuclear RNAs derived from endogenous or from  integrated viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lampel et al., 1997</xref>). For example, some transcriptionally active genes containing introns  display little or no association with SC35 speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Zhang  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lampel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al., 1999</xref>),  whereas the collagen gene which has numerous introns is  associated with speckles independent of its transcriptional  activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Xing et al., 1995</xref>). In that respect, we cannot rule  out the possibility of a gene-specific organization of transcription sites with respect to nuclear regions enriched in  splicing factors.</p><p>Of potential interest is the observation that active hsp  transcription sites are found adjacent to the speckles  rather than colocalizing with them, suggesting that transcription and splicing activities occur preferentially at the  edges of the speckles where PFs seem to be localized as  described by electron microscopy (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fakan,  1994</xref>). A similar observation has been reported for several  other genes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Schul et al., 1998a</xref>). This may  represent a mechanism to accelerate the release of nascent  transcripts from the sites of transcription, which would indeed be affected if transcription and splicing were to take  place in the core of the speckle where the concentration in  RNA Pol II and processing factors may be elevated. Alternatively, this situation may simply reflect gene-specific differences in the association with speckles. Whatever the hypothesis, our data show that the distribution of a specific  active gene as adjacent or overlapping with speckles does  not rely on the presence of intronic sequences in the gene.</p><p>Why are splicing factors present at sites in the nucleus  where they are apparently not required? A first hypothesis  to explain the recruitment of splicing factors to an intronless gene is that complexes containing splicing factors  could have other functions at the site of transcription in  addition to intron excision. This suggestion is supported by  a recent work in which we have shown that full-length nascent hsp70 transcripts are retained at the site of transcription for a period of &#x0003c;15 min after their completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Jolly  et al., 1998</xref>). Perhaps splicing factors could be involved in a  primary step of the transcription/splicing process to scan  nascent transcripts for the presence of introns. An alternative explanation is that active transcription sites would in  fact associate with a subset of active RNA Pol II to which  splicing factors are bound. This is supported by observations that splicing factors and other mRNA processing enzymes interact transiently with the hyperphosphorylated  CTD of RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Mortillaro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Vincent et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Yuryev et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cho et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Du and Warren,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">McCracken et al., 1997a</xref>,b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Schul et al., 1998b</xref>). Even  in mitosis when transcription is arrested, the association  between splicing factors and RNA Pol II persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kim et al.,  1997</xref>). At the cell biological level, at least a subset of RNA  Pol II colocalizes with splicing factors within the speckles  (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Thibodeau and Vincent, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bregman  et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Blencowe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Mortillaro et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Patturajan et al., 1998</xref>), as well as factors involved in the 5&#x02032;  capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cho et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">McCracken et al., 1997a</xref>) and in  the 3&#x02032; mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Krause et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Schul et al.,  1998b</xref>). The corecruitment of splicing factors and RNA  Pol II, together with the movement of genes towards  speckles, could be beneficial for the cell in several ways.  First, it would accelerate the splicing reaction. Second, by  ensuring a sufficient amount of splicing factors at the site  of transcription, this system would decrease the risk of  producing unspliced transcripts which may generate aberrant and nonfunctional proteins. Third, this system would  provide a feedback control mechanism to arrest transcription if splicing is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Yuryev et al., 1996</xref>). Fourth,  it would minimize the information quantity required to  displace the different factors to the sites of transcription,  since the polymerase and splicing factors would all be displaced together as a single complex. This would suggest  the existence of signals both in the transcription and processing apparatus and at the level of the chromosome and/or  within the primary transcript, which determine the recognition between active transcription sites and proteins involved in RNA biogenesis. Such targeting and/or retention  signals, if localized to the nascent transcripts, are not contained within the introns as demonstrated by our results.  Identifying these signaling pathways will provide clues to  understand the mechanisms of production and trafficking  of RNAs within the nucleus.</p><p>While a growing number of observations support the  idea of a compartimentation of transcription and processing activities in the nucleus, we may still have a simplified  view of a more complex biological situation generated by  the combination of multiple factors varying in a gene-specific and/or cell type&#x02013;specific manner, therefore proving to  be invalid for certain transcripts. Of particular importance  may be the chromosomal context of the gene, which could  dramatically influence the supply of splicing factors to the  gene because of physical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Smith et al., 1999</xref>).  We are convinced that further understanding of the complex organization of transcription and splicing activities  within the cell nucleus will come from a large scale analysis of specific endogenous genes, in particular genes with  distinctive transcriptional and splicing characteristics such  as heat shock genes or genes expressed in a tissue-specific  manner.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) RT-PCR analysis  of total mRNA extracts from  normal human fibroblasts submitted to different conditions:  37&#x000b0;C (lane a), 42&#x000b0;C for 1 h (lane  b), 45&#x000b0;C for 1 h (lane c), azetidine  10 mM for 2 h (lane d), and cadmium 75 &#x003bc;M for 4 h (lane e).
