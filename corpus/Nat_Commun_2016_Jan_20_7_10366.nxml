Understanding the gating mechanism of mechanosensitive channels is challenging because the stimulus seen by the channel reflects forces shared between the membrane, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Here we examine whether the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 is activated by force-transmission through the bilayer. To achieve this, we generate HEK293 cell membrane blebs largely free of cytoskeleton. Using the bacterial channel MscL, we calibrate the bilayer tension demonstrating that activation of MscL in blebs is identical to that in reconstituted bilayers. Utilizing a novel PIEZO1&#x02013;GFP fusion, we then show PIEZO1 is activated by bilayer tension in bleb membranes, gating at lower pressures indicative of removal of the cortical cytoskeleton and the mechanoprotection it provides. Thus, PIEZO1 channels must sense force directly transmitted through the bilayer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

The two subtypes, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, are currently the subject of intense research and have been shown to be involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes.

For example, mechanosensitive channels might be gated (i) directly by bilayer tension as seen with the MscS and MscL bacterial channel families as well as the two-pore domain K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels TREK-1 and TRAAK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (This is referred to as the &#x02018;Force-from-lipids' concept<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), or (ii) by tethering to the cytoskeleton and/or the extracellular matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. It is important to note that even if a channel is gated directly by bilayer tension, the tension in the bilayer can be modified by cytoskeletal proteins and linkages to the extracellular matrix. Thus the sensitivity of a channel to the mean stress in the cortex can be modified by alterations in an array of scaffold proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. One way to probe the role of the cytoskeleton in the activation of a mechanosensitive channel is to use cytoskeletal deficient membrane &#x02018;blebs'.</p><p>Blebs are rounded protrusions of the bilayer where connections between the cytoskeleton and the bilayer are largely broken<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. They are found in numerous processes including cytokinesis, cell motility and programmed cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The blebbing process itself is dynamic and tightly regulated by numerous factors. In a physiological setting, the lifetime of a bleb ranges from tens of seconds to minutes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Their formation may be induced by numerous stimuli including changes in external osmolarity. Bleb formation usually starts with a breakdown of cortical f-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Subsequent bleb growth is modulated by hydrostatic pressure and actomyosin contractility. During the expansion phase, the bleb membrane is still amenable to electrophysiological study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The challenge for electrophysiology is to maintain the decoupling of the cortical cytoskeleton long enough to measure channel activity since the cytoskeleton can be rebuilt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Using this research paradigm, we asked whether the PIEZO1 channel is gated by bilayer tension.</p><p>We first generated blebs deficient in f-actin and &#x003b2;-tubulin long enough for electrophysiological recording. We then characterized the mechanical environment of the blebbed membranes using as a probe MscL, a mechanosensitive channel gated directly by bilayer tension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The pipette suction required to gate MscL in blebs was three times less than in cell-attached patches, reflecting the fact that much of the cortical tension is supported by the cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Interestingly, the gating of MscL in blebs was almost identical to that observed in liposomes. To apply the same experimental paradigm to PIEZO1 channels, we created a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct of PIEZO1 (with the fluorophore inserted in the centre of the protein at position 1591), and showed that not only do these channels behave like wild-type (WT) PIEZO1 channels but they are present in the membrane blebs and can be activated by applied negative pressure to the patch pipette. Like MscL, PIEZO1 channels in blebs were more sensitive to applied tension than in cell-attached patches. Thus PIEZO1 appears to sense tension in the bilayer and is gated according to the &#x0201c;force-from lipids&#x0201d; principle, an evolutionarily conserved gating mechanism.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Blebbing HEK293 cells</title><p>We first explored the best way to make stable blebs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. We focused on three solutions: (1) Hypoosmotic sodium gluconate solution (&#x0223c;140&#x02009;mOsm), (2) Hyperosmotic sodium gluconate (&#x0223c;440&#x02009;mOsm), and (3) KCl Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The results were summarized by the number of cells that blebbed at various time points up to 12&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b&#x02013;e</xref>). The membrane integrity of cells after blebbing was monitored using a trypan blue assay. While the KCl Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free solution generated blebs, a high percentage of cells (&#x0003e;50&#x00025;) stained with trypan blue after &#x0223c;4&#x02009;h. The most effective solution was hypoosmotic sodium gluconate with &#x0003e;60&#x00025; cells exhibiting at least one bleb after 6&#x02009;h. Furthermore, this blebbing seemed to be dependent on the activity of myosin II based on the fact that blebbistatin greatly reduced the number of blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cytoskeletal deficiency in HEK293 membrane blebs</title><p>Next we investigated whether the resulting blebs were deficient in cortical cytoskeleton. We assayed f-actin using an Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin conjugate. We also visualized three GFP containing constructs expressed in HEK293 cells: a pIRES2&#x02013;EGFP PIEZO1 where GFP is expressed separately from the PIEZO1 channel, and two fusion proteins, one of PIEZO1 and one of MscL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). All the images show large rounded protrusions that grew up to 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in diameter. It was simple to identify the GFP fluorescence of the fusion proteins at the membrane boundary. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows blebs from cells expressing pIRES2&#x02013;EGFP PIEZO1 where free GFP was present in the cytoplasm and the cell was also stained with phalloidin. The arrows show blebs with GFP fluorescence but f-actin is not visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). In many cases, the blebs detached from the membrane surface and resembled liposomes as previously observed with Xenopus oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Using a &#x003b2;-tubulin-GFP, we showed that &#x003b2;-tubulin is also absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Blebs present a functionally different membrane environment</title><p>To assess whether the blebs had a different mechanical environment for the channel than a cell-attached patch, we used the well-characterized prokaryotic mechanosensitive channel MscL. This channel has been extensively studied and is known to gate in response to bilayer tension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. We generated a carboxy (C)-terminal MscL fusion protein and characterized its electrophysiological properties and found that in cell-attached patches it activated with a pressure threshold of 144&#x000b1;5&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (<italic>n</italic>=12; &#x000b1;s.e.m.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The pressure threshold is defined as the pressure at which the first channel current appears. The threshold was higher in cell-attached than in inside-out patches where the cytoskeleton is more disrupted (120&#x000b1;8&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg; <italic>n</italic>=17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,c</xref>). The pressure threshold was also 30&#x000b1;6&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic>=12) lower in excised patches where cell-attached activity as a reference was available before excision. The average number of channels per patch in excised patches was 13&#x000b1;3 (<italic>n</italic>=17). The pressure that gated the MscL&#x02013;cGFP fusion protein was higher than reported for MscL in HEK cells (&#x0223c;90&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This is likely due to modulation by the fusion of GFP to the C-terminal since the same effect was observed in bacterial spheroplasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In blebbed membranes, MscL activated at 56&#x000b1;5&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (<italic>n</italic>=7), close to the values reported for gating in liposomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Thus, the blebbed membrane is a different mechanical environment than the cell cortex and is more similar to liposomes rather than cell membranes. This emphasizes the mechanical influence of the cytoskeleton on plasma membrane stress and reaffirms the functional presence of the cytoskeleton in excised patches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>We further probed the environment using the more-sensitive MscL mutant, MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) where a hydrophilic residue in the hydrophobic pore causes a reduction in the energy required for gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. This channel showed a similar reduction in the pressure threshold for activation in the different membrane environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The G22S mutant enabled us to activate multichannel currents in the cell-attached configuration without rupturing the patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b&#x02013;i</xref>). Interestingly, the MscL&#x02013;GFP fusion constructs were not only confined to the plasma membrane but were also present in the membranes of organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p>We measured the gating curve in three patch configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and found a consistent leftward shift indicative of increased tension in the bilayer of blebbed membranes for a given amount of pipette suction. A similar shift was observed with ramp pressure protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,f,g</xref>). Ramp protocols allow more time for a redistribution of force than a pulse and this produced a larger shift in the <italic>P</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP since stress in the cytoskeleton had more time to relax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref>). This is depicted diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>.</p><p>We further probed how mechanoprotection by the cytoskeleton affected the activity of MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP by applying cytochalasin D (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) and colchicine (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) to HEK293 cells. In cells pre-treated with these cytoskeletal-disrupting agents, the pressure threshold was reduced in cell-attached and excised patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). As expected, the leftward shift (lower stress) in the gating curve elicited by excision was lost. Thus membranes treated with these compounds behave more like membrane blebs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PIEZO1&#x02013;1591&#x02013;GFP fusion protein behaves as WT</title><p>After characterizing MscL in blebbed membranes, we repeated the experiments using a fluorescently labelled PIEZO1 fusion construct. The necessity for a fluorescent construct in this situation stems from the fact that some proteins can be excluded from blebbing membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. With GFP at either the amino (N)- or C-terminal of PIEZO1, we found that in the cell-attached configuration, the channel kinetics showed delayed inactivation relative to controls. In addition, the channel number per patch for the N&#x02013;GFP fusion was much lower than WT, despite the presence of comparable amounts of protein. This may be a result of abrogated trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><p>We then introduced mCherry or GFP into an internal site in an effort to maintain activity. We tested five internal sites that are putative loop structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Surprisingly when we introduced mCherry to position 1591 (called PIEZO1&#x02013;1591&#x02013;mCherry), the kinetics were similar to the WT channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) with an inactivation time constant of &#x0223c;40&#x02009;ms in cell-attached mode. The other mutants displayed abnormal activity, for example mCherry inserted at position 1851 provided a response similar to that observed for N- or C-terminal modification as it did not inactivate and had small currents (<italic>n</italic>=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Three mutants (at positions 160, 724 and 855) produced no current (<italic>n</italic>=4). We confirmed that three of these constructs (N-terminal, C-terminal and 1591 insertion) expressed full-length protein by probing with a GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The response of PIEZO1&#x02013;1591&#x02013;mCherry using whole-cell recording is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, and the response was similar to the WT channel with a reversal potential near 0&#x02009;mV and robust mechanically induced currents.</p><p>The PIEZO1&#x02013;1591&#x02013;GFP construct also behaved similarly to wild-type channels including a reduction in unitary conductance with increasing external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and voltage-dependent inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a&#x02013;d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.

Both biochemical data and cryo-EM data suggest that a fluorophore inserted at position 1591, is likely to be intracellular and arranged close to the periphery of each &#x02018;wing'.

MscL channels in excised inside-out patches from cells required more pressure (2.5 times the pressure) to gate than in blebs.

This is supported by pretreatment with colchicine and cytochalasin D, which also reduced the force required to gate MscL in both cell-attached and excised configurations. The imaging of fluorescent PIEZO1 and TREK-1 showed that the two channel types are segregated to separate domains. A critical consequence is that the tension within each domain may be different since the line tension of the domains requires that the internal tension is different from external tension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. An interesting feature of the TREK-1 distribution was an apparent alignment of some channels to underlying linear cytoskeletal elements. This interaction is supported by the observation that a non-conducting point mutation in TREK-1 has a dramatic effect on the cytoskeletal reorganization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Although these data do not unequivocally support the idea that PIEZO1 resides in a &#x02018;cytoskeleton free' domain, they do illustrate that PIEZO1 resides in a different cellular domain to TREK-1. This is interesting and fits with the proposed functional crosstalk between these two types of channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, ultimately TREK-1 as well as the related protein TRAAK, sense force transmitted directly through the lipid bilayer despite their previously affirmed association with the cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. If PIEZO1 channels were gated by bilayer tension, like TREK-1, TRAAK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, MscL and MscS-like channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, we would expect to see a similar trend in its activity when compared with MscL in bleb-attached patches, and this is what is found. PIEZO1 can be activated in bleb membranes with less applied pressure than in cells. Furthermore, this is unaffected by interfering with either actin polymerization (CytoD) or microtubule polymerization (colchicine) providing further support for an absence of cytoskeletal linkages in blebbed membranes. However, if PIEZO1 is gated by bilayer tension, an obvious question that arises is: &#x02018;does purified PIEZO1 protein exhibit mechanosensitive gating when reconstituted?'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The answer thus far seems to be no and there are a number of possible explanations for this. The data from planar bilayers do not exhibit inactivation kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This could arise because the data actually came from occasional channels returning from the inactivated (tension insensitive) state since the resting tension in bilayers is on the order of 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;mN&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Alternatively, as others have reported, we saw rapid rundown of PIEZO1 channel currents in the excised inside-out configuration, and recent work has shown that this rundown is correlated with a loss of phosphoinositides, in particular PIP2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). The lack of PIP<sub>2</sub> in reconstituted bilayers may explain the lack of response to applied membrane tension documented in this environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The fact that PIEZO1 channels can be activated in blebs virtually eliminates the possibility that activation requires binding to the cytoskeleton and biochemical data have shown no specific association of PIEZO1 with other proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Future work should aim to address the question as to why does purified PIEZO protein not exhibit mechanosensitive gating when reconstituted; answering such a central question will no doubt uncover important functional information.</p><p>It is important to note that our work does not preclude modulation by structural proteins of the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix. For example, PIEZO1 is sensitized by the expression of STOML3, a cytoskeleton-associated protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, and this may well alter the force distribution to the bilayer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. In fact we have already shown that PIEZO1 currents elicited by cell indentation are markedly reduced by pre-treatment with cytochalasin D. This, however, is a result of force transmission in this configuration and not a direct link to the channel as when we pre-stressed the bilayer with hypo-osmotic shock in the presence of cytochalasin D, the currents were boosted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>Here we have provided the first direct assessment of the tension sensitivity of PIEZO1. The first method utilized the gating of MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP channels in inside-out patches (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub>=11.3&#x000b1;0.6&#x02009;mN&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; <italic>n</italic>=3). We then used this value to estimate the tension required to gate PIEZO1 channels from the pressures required to gate PIEZO1 when co-expressed with MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP. This gives a <italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of &#x0223c;4.5&#x02009;mN&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

Applying Laplace's law to heterogeneous three-dimensional structures is a simplification of the complex material properties of a cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, but it does provide a useful upper limit of the magnitude of the forces required to gate the channel. Furthermore, an inherent characteristic of mechanosensitive channels is that they undergo large in-plane area expansion (&#x00394;<italic>A</italic>) during gating allowing the tension field to do work on the channel. From the tension and the free energy difference between the closed and open states, we estimated &#x00394;<italic>A</italic>&#x0223c;15&#x02009;nm<sup>2</sup> for MscL&#x02013;G22S&#x02013;cGFP fitting well with previous estimates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. PIEZO1 also appears to undergo a large in-plane expansion of &#x0223c;8&#x02009;nm<sup>2</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). These calculations assume that the free energy of gating is driven purely by a change of in-plane area and that may not be completely accurate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.</p><p>The quantification of PIEZO1 gating may be used as an internal calibrator of how efficiently a stimulus can reach the channel. Our data also emphasize that drug screens of PIEZO channels are predicted to be sensitive to cytoskeletal modulation and lipid modulation that can change the distribution of stresses between the bilayer, the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Collectively, these results illustrate the utility of prokaryotic mechanosensitive channels as models and tools for studying mechanosensory transduction, and the wide applicability of basic biophysical principles in the gating of mechanosensitive channels irrespective of their evolutionary provenance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PIEZO1 and MscL GFP fusion constructs</title><p><italic>Construction of C- and N-terminally labelled PIEZO1</italic>.

Confocal images were made using an inverted confocal microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a water immersion long working distance objective (&#x000d7; 63; NA 1.15; Carl Zeiss).

Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with a 4&#x00025; solution of paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30&#x02009;min. After removal of the fixing solution, cells were washed and mounting media, Prolong Gold (Life Technologies), was applied to the cells. These were subsequently inverted and sealed on a glass coverslip. Data were collected by SIM (API, Seattle) with a &#x000d7; 60 objective NA 1.4 oil.

The nitrocellulose membranes were probed simultaneously with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; Cat no&#x02014;ab290) and a mouse monoclonal anti &#x003b1;-actinin antibody at 1:1,000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA Cat no&#x02014;sc17829) overnight. Both anti-mouse IRDye800 and anti-rabbit IRDye680 (Li-Cor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE, USA) at a 1:20,000 dilution were incubated with the membrane and the PIEZO1 proteins were detected using the Li-Cor Odyssey system (Li-Cor Biotechnology).

Initiation of blebs can be instigated by a variety of stimuli, and certain cell lines continually bleb (for example, M12 cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). The initiation phase usually involves a focal weakening or rupture of the cortical cytoskeleton and bleb expansion continues largely devoid of cortical f-actin driven by hydrostatic pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref> and actomyosin contractility.
