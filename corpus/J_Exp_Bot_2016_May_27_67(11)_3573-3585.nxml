</xref>). Silica depositions underneath leaf cuticles form the subcuticular double layer which contributes to biotic stress resistance and reduces water loss by transpiration, thereby improving water use efficiency particularly under abiotic stresses (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hattori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, decreased lipid peroxidation, reduced membrane permeabilization, and higher activities of stress defense enzymes could be linked to Si nutrition under drought, cold, and salt stress (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Farooq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Savvas <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> reported increased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates and a substantial decrease in the uptake and translocation of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) ions into leaves of salt-stressed zucchini in the presence of Si in the growth medium. Similarly, Si deposition in the cell wall of roots correlated with immobilization of toxic metals such as aluminum (Al) in barley (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Hammond <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), manganese (Mn) in cucumber (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and Cd in maize (<xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">Vaculik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Hence Si affects entry and detoxification of metal ions in the plant body. Improved antioxidative capacity and increased concentrations of ascorbate and glutathione are also suggested to explain Si-mediated metal stress tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Yamaji, 2006</xref>). These nutritional benefits support the view that Si functions as a beneficial element for plants. Its inclusion in the list of elements essential for higher plants is debatable. Most studies elucidate the importance of Si in a specific physiological and biochemical context, and for this Si is added either prior to or simultaneously with the stressor. Thus, questions as to the reversibility of stress effects by treating plants afterwards with Si but also in relation to the molecular mechanisms involved remain unanswered.</p><p content-type="indent">To understand the beneficial Si syndrome in its entirety we need to target and identify genes involved in signaling or regulatory pathways. Recently, a new family of genes with 18 members termed SAPs (stress-associated proteins) was identified in rice. An important role for SAPs in abiotic stress acclimation is indicated by expression profiling and transgenic approaches. SAP family members are characterized by the presence of an A20/AN1 zinc-finger domain. Proteins with such a domain are present in all eukaryotes and are also well characterized in animals (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Members of the SAP gene family present in rice and other plant species show specific inducibility to one or the other abiotic stresses (<xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Vij and Tyagi, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Solanke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Giri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Little is known about their modulation under heavy metal stress, in particular Cd toxicity. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, expression of AtSAP10 containing multiple cysteine and histidine residues in the AN1 and A20 domains could be linked to metal binding and confers tolerance to nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and Mn toxicity (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Dixit and Dhankher, 2011</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that SAPs play decisive roles in stress acclimation; for example, OsSAP1 overexpression improves drought tolerance of transgenic rice (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dansana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">To address the question of Si-induced reversibility of Cd stress effects and the suitability of SAPs as readout for stress intensity, a hydroponic study was conducted to characterize the expression profiles of 18 SAP gene family members in rice exposed to Cd stress and their respective modulation by Si application. We hypothesized that post-stress application of Si recovers growth impairment caused by Cd toxicity through altering stress-related proteins. The results will provide kinetic insight into the Si effect in plant stress tolerance and address early response mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) cv.

After 10 d, eight uniform seedlings were selected and transferred to 5 liter plastic pots containing 0.5&#x000d7; Hoagland solution.

Hydroponic solution was renewed every 5 d for the first 20 d, then every 3 d for the remainder of the experiment, and the pH was adjusted to 6.2 by using either 1M HCl or 0.5M KOH on a daily basis. At the age of 38 d, plants were stressed with 10 &#x000b5;M CdCl<sub>2</sub> added to the nutrient solution for 8 d, while the control plants were maintained in Hoagland medium lacking Cd. Silicon treatments (0 or 0.6mM Si) were introduced 4 d after Cd stress by using sodium silicate (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Si) solution. An equivalent amount of NaCl was added to the Si-free plants to compensate for the Na content of the Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Si-treated plants. The steady-state quantum yield of photosystem II (&#x003a6;PSII) was measured in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96h after Si supplementation (Mini-PAM Fluorometer, Walz, Germany) under light conditions as indicated above. Both young and mature leaves were selected randomly from each treatment and measured several times. The photosynthetic yield was calculated according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For biochemical parameters, both leaves and roots were harvested 4 d after Cd stress [i.e. prior to Si application (42 d)] and also at the end of the experiment (46-day-old plants; 4 d after Si supply), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02013;80 <sup>o</sup>C until further analyses.

Also 24% less Cd was translocated to shoots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, mean Cd contents of leaf blades were insignificantly lower following Si supply. Furthermore, the presence of Cd in the growth medium significantly lowered the accumulation of essential macro- and micronutrients such as calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and Zn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw175/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>).

Si-dependent recovery from pre-established stress conditions has not been analyzed in detail. This experimental design promises access to a kinetic and mechanistic understanding.

In contrast, Si supply prevented further development of damage and improved &#x003a6;PSII within 48h, reaching maximal values close to those of non-stressed plants.

The results indicate a lowered oxidative load of Cd-stressed rice in the presence of Si (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2C</xref>, D, 3A, B). The major difference between ascorbate and glutathione response was that ascorbate levels further increased in both leaves and roots under Si/Cd treatment beyond the already elevated levels found in Cd-treated rice. The enlarged ascorbate pool size indicates stimulated defense capacity by providing additional substrate for the water&#x02013;water cycle, and for quenching of the tocopherol radical and ROS, particularly H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gest <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This type of positive Si effect on the water&#x02013;water cycle was described in the context of salinity stress and mycorrhization (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Garg and Bhandari, 2016</xref>). NTPs under non-stress conditions tentatively match the glutathione pool (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Metwally <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) as also seen in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). As previously reported for barley (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Finkemeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), Cd stress reduced root contents of glutathione which was converted to phytochelatins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This is apparent from the greater difference between NPTs and glutathione which reached &#x0003e;244 nmol g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> FW in leaves, and 306 nmol g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> FW in roots after 8 d exposure to Cd stress. The value dropped to 118 nmol g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> FW in leaves and 257 nmol g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> FW in roots from Cd/Si plants. The Si-induced drop in phytochelatin-bound thiols indicates decreasing concentrations of free Cd in the cytosol. Phytochelatins mediate sequestration into the vacuole. For this study, it is important that Si supply to Cd-stressed plants significantly increased the glutathione proportion within the NPT pool of roots. It is concluded that lower Cd levels in the cytoplasm reduced the PCS1 activity and the drainage of GSH into phytochelatin synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The recovery experiment advances the study of <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> who reported similar increases in the glutathione pool of Cd-stressed Brassica plants when Si and Cd were supplied simultaneously. Apparently Cd-induced phytochelatin synthesis drained more glutathione than could be synthesized in roots, leading to a &#x0003e;5-fold increase in NPTs. The opposite pattern in leaves, namely up-regulation of glutathione in Cd-treated tissue and down-regulation upon Cd/Si treatment, indicates that stimulation of glutathione synthesis was able to overcompensate for the drainage into phytochelatin synthesis. <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> reported synergistic effects of simultaneous Cd and Si supply on glutathione contents of <italic>Brassica chinensis</italic>. The discrepancies might be caused by the entirely different experimental design and distinct nutrient solution, as well as species differences.</p><p content-type="indent">The elemental analysis revealed reduced Cd accumulation in roots in the presence of Si (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Cd is first absorbed apoplastically and then transported across the plasma membrane with the help of secondary cation transporters such as <italic>IRT1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Clemens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Clemens, 2006</xref>). Except for Cd-hyperaccumulating species, Cd accumulates more in roots than in shoots and leaves, which is in line with our observations (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Kirham, 2006</xref>). Si uptake is an active process particularly in silica-accumulating species such as rice (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Si strongly binds to cell wall components and contributes to cross-linking of cell wall structures. Si-induced structural alterations and blockage of the apoplasmic transport route are suggested to reduce Cd uptake by roots and translocation to shoots (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Lukacova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, Cd concentrations in leaves did not differ significantly between plants with or without Si. Apparently substantial Cd amounts had already accumulated during the first 4 d of Cd exposure before the start of the Si treatment. Thus, Si-dependent blockage of uptake and transfer of Cd from roots to shoots cannot explain the recovery of photosynthesis in the recovery experiment. About 80% of the Si absorbed under Cd stress was transferred to shoots and leaves. As a consequence, Si levels were highly similar in different tissues of Si-treated control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that the positive effects of Si administration on above-ground tissue are caused by local effects of Si accumulating in the shoot and not by effects on long-distance Cd transport. Enhanced defense as described above for ascorbate and compatible compartmentation, for example in the vacuole, are probably involved in the process.</p><p content-type="indent">Recently, <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Pavlovic <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> reported that Si alleviates Fe deficiency in cucumber at two mechanistic levels, namely indirectly by increasing root apoplastic iron (Fe) uptake and directly by modulation of strategy-I-responsive genes involved in synthesis of Fe-mobilizing compounds. Controlled uptake, long-distance transport, and utilization of the functionally important micro- and macroelements plays crucial roles in maintaining optimal metabolism, plant growth, and high productivity. Element analyses suggest that differential Ca translocation in the presence or absence of Cd and Si contributes to the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus. However, it should be noted that Ca contents do not equate to Ca concentrations. Ca is known to alleviate Cd toxicity (<xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki, 2005</xref>). In addition, the repressed delivery of other elements such as Mg, K, Zn, and S was also partially improved by Si supply under Cd stress. Improved utilization of micronutrients (Fe and Zn) and macronutrients (Ca, Mg, and K) upon Si supply to chromium (Cr)- and Cd-stressed plants was previously reported by <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi et al. (2012a, b</xref>). However, in their study, Cd and Si were supplied simultaneously, thus recovery was not a point of interest. Here it is shown that already established negative effects of Cd are reversed upon Si supplementation. This is important since it indicates the action of mechanisms beyond uptake in roots and long-distance transport. Apparently, Si also facilitated detoxification of Cd that had already been incorporated during the first 4 d. The results also exclude a major function for Si in developmental processes underlying the Cd acclimation response, since the effects were observed in adult leaves.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Si-mediated regulation of Cd-induced gene expression</title><p>The biochemical data provided compelling evidence for the beneficial effects of Si on the physiology of Cd-stressed rice.

<italic>SAP1</italic>, <italic>SAP14</italic>, and <italic>Hsf31</italic> in Cd and Cd/Si treatments diverged already within 24h; in fact, <italic>SAP1</italic> significantly more than <italic>SAP14</italic> and <italic>Hsf31</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, C). SAP1 and 14 belong to the recently identified SAP gene family with 18 members in rice. Overexpression of SAPs in rice and other plant species confers tolerance to various abiotic stresses. For example, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> reported the up-regulation of <italic>OsSAP1</italic> upon mechanical injury, submergence, abscisic acid treatment, drought, salt, and cold stress. Similarly, <italic>OsSAP9</italic> was found to be involved in stress response against cold, heat, and oxidative stress (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Their involvement in response to multiple stresses has been reported also for, for example, maize, Arabidopsis, tomato, and banana (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Vij and Tyagi, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Solanke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Giri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The stimulatory action of Cd on <italic>SAP1</italic> and <italic>SAP14</italic> probably indicates a role in Cd-related stress response, and the reversal by Si in parallel with improved growth tentatively underscores this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, C). <italic>SAP1</italic> and <italic>SAP14</italic> have been reported to be up-regulated under cold, salt, and dehydration stress (<xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">Vij and Tyagi, 2006</xref>). Their early response indicates that the involved signaling pathway is linked to a rather fast and possibly linearly Cd-dependent stress-sensing mechanism such as deviation from redox and ROS homeostasis. Si would then support re-establishment of redox homeostasis.</p><p content-type="indent">Phytochelatins synthesized from GSH have long been known for their role in heavy metal binding and detoxification (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Finkemeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">Yadav, 2010</xref>). Therefore, up-regulation of <italic>PCS1</italic> is a rather specific response to Cd toxicity. The Cd-induced up-regulation of <italic>PCS1</italic> was reversed after 36h of Si supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In Arabidopsis, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Khandekar and Leisner (2011)</xref> found that the relative expression of <italic>PCS1</italic> in leaves is enhanced by Si under Cu stress as compared with stressed plants lacking a Si supply, while expression of the metallothionein gene <italic>MT1a</italic> is down-regulated in the simultaneous presence of Si and Cu. Thus there exist species-specific differences. It may be speculated that Si activated a more efficient compartmentalization and detoxification of Cd. The element analyses support this scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). On the other hand, Si supplementation stopped the further accumulation of <italic>PCS1</italic> transcript but failed to lower it to the control level. This may either indicate a long half-life of the <italic>PCS1</italic> transcript or sustained Cd stress in the cytosol.</p><p content-type="indent">In order to address potential signaling elements and regulators, we selected five Cd-responsive TFs, namely AP2/Erf020, AP2/Erf, bHLH, NAC6, and Hsf31, from rice transcriptome analyses, and subsequently focused on three of them which revealed an almost complete reversal upon Si application to Cd-stressed rice. <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> reported up-regulation of <italic>AP2/Erf020</italic>-TF under Cd stress. Likewise a genome-wide transcriptome analysis in Arabidopsis revealed strong (&#x0003e;30-fold) up-regulation upon Cd stress of <italic>AP2/Erf019</italic>-TF (At1g22810), a close homolog of <italic>AP2-Erf020</italic> in rice (<xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Further, Hsf31 was chosen because its Arabidopsis homolog HsfA3 (At5g03720) was implicated in controlling the expressional up-regulation of ascorbate peroxidase 2. This mechanism was suggested to promote tolerance to oxidative stress in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>Hsf31</italic> significantly responded to the Si supplementation within 36h and returned to the level of the Cd-free control plants within 2 d. <italic>Hsf31</italic> is a member of the antioxidant regulatory network. The rapid and complete reversal of <italic>Hsf31</italic> transcript to the control level with Si probably indicates efficient readjustment of redox homeostasis.</p><p content-type="indent">The most delayed bifurcation was seen for Os<italic>NAC6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). <italic>OsNAC6</italic> is drought induced and targets downstream stress-responsive genes such as apetala 2-TFs, Zn-finger proteins, and MYB TFs. Its overexpression enhances drought and salt stress tolerance in transgenic rice (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Rachmat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The late response of <italic>NAC6</italic> may tentatively be explained by ionic or osmotic imbalances under Cd stress (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hassan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) which may be reversed by Si only slowly. Si is known to affect drought tolerance, for example in sorghum by increased silicification or altering internal barriers (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hassan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Si effects on regulation of metal transporters in higher plants have only been addressed in a few studies such as that of <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> who found that Si application under Cu stress reduced the activity of <italic>HMA5</italic> in roots of Arabidopsis. In our study, the response of metal transporters to Cd and Cd/Si treatments was barely distinguishable, except for <italic>OsHMA3</italic> which is a member of heavy metal ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw175/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>). Here, expression of <italic>HMA3</italic> in roots of Cd-stressed rice was not different from that in controls which tentatively fits a report by <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> who found a significant up-regulation of <italic>HMA3</italic> in roots of Cd-stressed rice only during the early stress period at day 1, but the difference largely disappeared during extended exposure. Here, we observed that the expression of <italic>HMA3</italic> was significantly suppressed due to the presence of Si under Cd stress, which indicates that Si might be involved in Cd sequestration; therefore, less <italic>HMA3</italic> would be needed. This finding is in line with our results from element analyses where we found reduced Cd levels in roots associated with Si application.</p><p content-type="indent">In conclusion, the synergistic and antagonistic responses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, metabolites, and element levels, as well as <italic>PCS</italic>, <italic>SAP</italic> genes, <italic>AP2/Erf020</italic>, <italic>Hsf31</italic>, <italic>NAC6</italic>, and transporter transcripts to Cd and Cd/Si supplementation, and the distinct kinetics of the antagonistic response indicate that Si interferes with Cd stress via several mechanisms. Decreased Cd uptake and translocation, as well as improved compartmentation, readjustment of redox homeostasis, and strengthened antioxidant capacity as indicated by elevated ascorbate levels contribute to the Si effect. Among the members of the SAP family, SAP1 and SAP14 are promising candidates for involvement in the Cd toxicity response, while SAP3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16 responded to Si alone and thus might be of interest for further consideration in general stress responses and Si-dependent stress amelioration. Recently, overexpression of OsSAP1 in rice was shown to improve water stress tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dansana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The overexpressing rice lines revealed alterations in their transcriptome, with many transcripts assigned to the gene ontology group of stress-responsive genes. These findings support the conclusion that the up-regulation of <italic>SAP1</italic> in Cd-stressed rice and the reversal of this effect by Si indicate efficient stress relief by Si supplementation. The Si-induced recovery of Cd-stressed rice will allow for identifying early signaling responses by, for example, transcriptome profiling in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
