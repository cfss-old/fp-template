Fc epsilon RII is known to be involved in IgE production and response. Interleukin-4 is being recognized as a major cytokine up-regulating IgE production. Hence the present study is aimed at investigating the role of interleukin-4 and Fc epsilon RII in the pathogenesis of MCNS. IgE was measured by ELISA. Fc epsilon RII was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell scanner (FAC-scan) by double antibody staining with anti Leu16-FITC and anti Leu20-PE. Soluble IgE receptor was measured by ELISA using anti CD23 antibody (3-5-14). Interleukin-4 activities were measured by CD23 expression on purified human tonsillar B cells. Serum IgE levels were significantly higher in MCNS (1,507 +/- 680 IU/dl) than in normal controls (123 +/- 99.2 IU/dl). A significantly higher expression of membrane Fc epsilon RII was noted for MCNS (41 +/- 12%) than that in normal controls (18 +/- 6.2%) (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Soluble CD23 levels were also significantly higher in MCNS (198 +/- 39.3%) than in normal controls (153 +/- 13.4) (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Interleukin-4 activity in sera of MCNS (12U/ml) was also significantly higher than normal controls (4.5U/ml). These results indicate that increased production of Fc epsilon RII and interleukin-4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MCNS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
