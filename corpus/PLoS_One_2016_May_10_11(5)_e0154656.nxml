Partial efficacy (31.2%) of the Thai RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial has been correlated with Antibody-dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the V1V2 region of the HIV-1 envelope. This has led to speculation that ADCC and other antibody-dependent cellular effector functions might provide an important defense against mucosal acquisition of HIV-1 infection. However, the ability of antibody-dependent cellular effector mechanisms to impact on early mucosal transmission events will depend on a variety of parameters including effector cell type, frequency, the class of Fc-Receptor (FcR) expressed, the number of FcR per cell and the glycoslyation pattern of the induced antibodies. In this study, we characterize and compare the frequency and phenotype of IgG (CD16 [Fc&#x003b3;RIII], CD32 [Fc&#x003b3;RII] and CD64 [Fc&#x003b3;RI]) and IgA (CD89 [Fc&#x003b1;R]) receptor expression on effector cells within male and female genital mucosal tissue, colorectal tissue and red blood cell-lysed whole blood. The frequency of FcR expression on CD14+ monocytic cells, myeloid dendritic cells and natural killer cells were similar across the three mucosal tissue compartments, but significantly lower when compared to the FcR expression profile of effector cells isolated from whole blood, with many cells negative for all FcRs. Of the three tissues tested, penile tissue had the highest percentage of FcR positive effector cells. Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine the location of CD14+, CD11c+ and CD56+ cells within the three mucosal tissues. We show that the majority of effector cells across the different mucosal locations reside within the subepithelial lamina propria. The potential implication of the observed FcR expression patterns on the effectiveness of FcR-dependent cellular effector functions to impact on the initial events in mucosal transmission and dissemination warrants further mechanistic studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID)</institution></funding-source><award-id>UM1-AI100645-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shattock</surname><given-names>Robin J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a grant awarded to RJS by the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID) #UM1-AI100645-01.

While it has been suggested that antibody-dependent cellular effector functions might have important defensive roles against pathogenic infections at mucosal surfaces, little is known about the phenotype and density of antibody effector cells found within these tissues.</p><p>The partial protective efficacy (31.2%) of the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial in Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] has driven an enhanced interest in the role of non-neutralizing antibodies in mucosal protection. Extensive correlates analysis of the RV144 trial identified that a reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition was positively associated with the development of serum IgG antibodies (particularly IgG3) to the V1V2 region of the Env trimer able to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This positive association was negated in the presence of high levels of IgA antibodies able to block Fc-gamma receptor (Fc&#x003b3;R) mediated ADCC through competitive binding to V1V2 [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These observations have led to the suggestion that ADCC activity might be an important component of prophylactic vaccines against HIV-1 and potentially a mechanistic correlate of protection in the RV144 trial [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Antibody-dependent cellular effector functions are triggered by the localized clustering of cell membrane Fc receptors (FcR) through binding to the Fc portion of complexed antibodies: in the case of HIV-1, opsonized (or antibody coated) infected cells and/or cells coated with opsonized viral particles [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ADCC is most efficiently triggered through antibody Fc engagement of CD16 (Fc&#x003b3;RIII), predominantly found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and subpopulations of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Engagement of CD16 triggers the directional release across the lytic synapse of the content of cytotoxic granules and, in the case of NK cells, the expression of cell death-inducing molecules, resulting in death of the opsonized cells. ADCC can also be triggered by crosslinking of Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64) and Fc&#x003b3;RII (CD32) on myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells), although the mechanism and efficiency of cell-mediated extracellular lysis remains controversial. However, other antibody-dependent effector functions, specifically antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular viral inhibition (ADCVI) may also impact on initial events in mucosal HIV-1 infection [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast to ADCC, which for myeloid cells requires incubation times of up to 24h, ADCP is reported to occur rapidly and efficiently within 1&#x02013;4h [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ADCP predominately acts through engagement of CD32 (Fc&#x003b3;RII), CD64 (Fc&#x003b3;RI) and CD89 (Fc&#x003b1;R) on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to phagocytosis of opsonized virus [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and infected cells and their subsequent degradation [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. ADCVI can be mediated by ADCC, ADCP, and the release of HIV inhibitory &#x003b2;-chemokines blocking the onward infection of susceptible cells, and is a functional readout of the sum of these antibody-mediated effector mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In terms of vaccine design, it is important to determine the phenotype and frequency of antibody effector cells present within the mucosal portals of HIV-1 transmission. Natural Killer (NK) cells, Myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and cells of a monocyte lineage (CD14+) are the predominant cells involved in Fc effector functions. Research conducted in the 1990s used RNA and histological techniques to demonstrate expression of CD16 (Fc&#x003b3;RIII) and CD32 (Fc&#x003b3;RII) on colorectal and cervical mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. More recently, studies have used flow cytometry to attempt to further characterize immune cells within cervical tissue [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, there have been no comprehensive studies to characterize and directly compare immune cells from different mucosal sites associated with the sexual transmission of HIV-1.</p><p>The ability of antibody-dependent cellular effector mechanisms to impact on early mucosal transmission events will depend on a variety of parameters including effector cell type frequency, the class of FcR expressed, the number of FcR per cell, and the glycoslyation pattern of the induced antibodies. Therefore, in this study we sought to determine the frequency and phenotype of IgG (CD16 [Fc&#x003b3;RIII], CD32 [Fc&#x003b3;RII] and CD64 [Fc&#x003b3;RI]) and IgA (CD89 [Fc&#x003b1;R]) receptor expression on effector cells within penile glans, ectocervical and colorectal tissue using tissue digestion and multicoloured flow cytometry techniques. The overall cellular profile of immune cells within mucosal tissue was also assessed. The results from the characterization of tissue cells were compared to those seen in red blood cell-lysed whole blood. In addition, deconvolution immunofluorescent microscopy was used to identify the location of immune effector cells and their associated FcR within the three types of mucosal tissue.</p><p>FcR expression on immune effector cells isolated from all three mucosal tissue types was lower when compared to whole blood-derived immune effector cells.

Gut tissue-resident macrophages are almost exclusively derived from the recruitment of blood monocytes [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and it is therefore possible that the higher frequency of CD14+ cells observed in colorectal tissue when compared to the two other mucosal tissues (cervical and penile glans) investigated is linked to a higher influx of these cells from the circulation.</p><p>In line with previous studies, our data show that neutrophils are the major leucocytes found within whole blood [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], yet a minor cell subset within skin (penile glans) [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], ectocervical [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and colorectal tissue [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Indeed, we isolated so few neutrophils from mucosal tissues that it was not possible to accurately determine the FcR expression on the surface of these cells. Neutrophils isolated from whole blood have been shown to constitutively express CD16b and CD89 at high levels and CD16a and CD32 at low levels [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. CD64 can be induced to express on the surface of neutrophils leading to increased ADCC activity [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given that neutrophils are commonly recruited during inflammation, it is possible that this cell subset could still play an important role in vaccine-induced immunity to HIV-1.</p><p>As previously determined, where immune effector cells were found, they tended to be located in the sub-epithelial and basal layers of the mucosal tissue [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This could be of relevance when considering the accessibility of these cells to interact with vaccine-induced HIV-1 antibodies and prevent early viral transmission events.</p><p>Downstream effector functions during Fc-FcR activation are dependent upon the FcR activated and effector cell phenotype. The CD16 receptor, Fc&#x003b3;RIII, is the intermediate affinity receptor for monomeric IgG and is most commonly associated with NK cell-mediated ADCC activity including release of lytic vesicles containing perforin and granzyme, but also with the induction of phagocytosis of immune complexes and cytokine release. CD32, Fc&#x003b3;RII, is a low affinity IgG Fc-receptor that requires antibodies to have formed immune complexes with the antigen to trigger further downstream effects such as target cell lysis and/or phagocytosis. CD64, Fc&#x003b3;RI, is the high affinity IgG Fc-receptor, which has particular affinity for IgG1 and IgG3 [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Lastly CD89, Fc&#x003b1;R, is the IgA receptor, binding aggregated immunoglobulin A complexed with antigen leading to phagocytosis and ADCC [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Fc&#x003b3;R have been implicated in the regulation of DC activity and are thought to play an integral role in determining whether inflammatory or tolerogenic responses are initiated during DC antigen presentation to T cell subsets [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>CD16, commonly associated with ADCC, was observed at high levels on NK cells isolated from penile and cervical tissue and whole blood, but was low in colorectal tissue, in line with a previous study, which identified NK cells within normal colorectal tissue to be of a CD56+ CD16l<sup>o/-</sup> phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Low levels of CD16 expression were detected within CD14+ cells, whereas the receptors more closely associated with the induction of ADCP and ADCVI (CD32, CD64 and CD89) were seen at comparatively higher levels. These data suggest ADCP and ADVCI might have increased potential over ADCC for impacting on HIV-1 transmission events.</p><p>CD32 is thought to be the most broadly expressed Fc&#x003b3;R on immune effector cells found in the blood [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Results here support this statement and indicate that it is also the most prolific Fc&#x003b3;R expressed across all three mucosal tissue types investigated, with data showing high expression levels on both CD14+ cells and mDC. CD32 is expressed as both inhibitory (CD32B) or activating (CD32A or CD32C) forms. These are capable of modulating the immune response depending on the presence or absence of co-stimulatory signals, such as engagement of CD40 or Toll-like receptors, which will promote an inflammatory response in DC [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although this study was not designed to distinguish between these CD32 receptor phenotypes, their expression across different mucosal tissue types would be important to classify in future studies. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that antibodies from HIV-1 controllers and untreated progressors exhibit increased phagocytic activity, altered Fc domain glycosylation, and skewed interactions with CD32a and CD32b in both bulk plasma and HIV-specific IgG [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These data suggest specificity of vaccine-induced antibodies for CD32a over CD32b may be important for harnessing mucosal antibody-dependent effector function.</p><p>We show significantly lower levels of CD64 on the surface of CD14+ monocytic cells isolated from all three mucosal tissues when compared with freshly isolated whole blood. It is known that loss of CD64 on cell surfaces is an early indicator of myeloid cell maturation [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This observation likely reflects that the CD14+ cell population found within mucosal tissue is of a more mature phenotype than that found within whole blood and could be important when considering the ease of inducing CD64-specific effector immune responses at mucosal surfaces through vaccination.</p><p>CD89 expression was found at low levels on the surface on all NK cells, irrespective of their origin. On the surface of CD14+ monocytic cells and mDC, CD89 was found at comparatively similar levels in all three mucosal tissue types investigated but, for CD14+ monocytic cells, at significantly lower levels when compared to the same cell types isolated from whole blood. This observation is similar to previous studies looking at CD89 expression in tissues, including gastrointestinal and skin [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>FcR expression on monocytes, mDC, NK cells and neutrophils are regulated by numerous factors. Cytokines such as IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; have been shown to upregulate the expression of Fc&#x003b3;R on monocytes and PMN [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; expression can upregulate Fc&#x003b3;R and CD89 expression on NK cells [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that IL-10 downregulates Fc&#x003b3;R expression on monocytes [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Cytokine production in a mucosal environment, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, can be influenced by factors such as diet, pre/probiotics and antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Cyclical hormonal changes within the female reproductive tract also alter the cytokine milieu [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For penile tissue, differences in cytokine production have been noted between inner &#x00026; outer foreskin and the penile glans [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and additional studies have investigated cytokine profiles in penile foreskin in healthy and HIV-1 infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, other sexually transmitted infections are highly likely to influence cytokine profiles and FcR expression. In broader terms, studies performed in skin also indicate that cytokine profiles differ within this tissue when compared to the periphery [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It should therefore be considered that the lower basal expression levels, but higher diversity of FcR seen in the three mucosal tissue tested in this study are likely as a result of differences in the local environment when compared to effector cells isolated from whole blood.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that the mucosal tissues sampled in this study were all obtained from patients attending clinics in London, UK. It is possible that FcR expression profiles could differ in individuals living in other parts of the world where there are additional external influences. For example, studies have demonstrated that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection induces upregulation of Fc&#x003b3;R on monocytes and subsets of DC [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154656.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These environmental factors could be relevant when considering potential mucosal FcR-dependent responses to HIV-1 vaccine trials initiated in malaria endemic areas. The data presented here serve to provide an important baseline that will facilitate the broader study of mucosal FcR expression in populations at high risk for HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Together, the results show that immune cells of mucosal tissue are phenotypically different when compared to those found in the periphery, which may have important implications for the potential of antibody-dependent cellular effector mechanisms to impact on HIV-1 transmission events. To date, most <italic>in vitro</italic> ADCC assays use blood-derived NK cells, neutrophil, monocytes or macrophages. While blood-derived monocytes mediate similar levels of ADCC to NK cells [<xref rid="pone.0154656.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], it is unclear as to the relative potency of their mucosal counterparts. Indeed, our studies demonstrate that a large proportion of mucosal myeloid cells are negative for all FcR. Furthermore, mucosal myeloid cells positive for FcR displayed a greater diversity of FcR expression than those in the periphery, which presented more uniform levels of expression within any one population. Such diversity adds additional complexity to potential tailoring of vaccine-induced humoral responses to promote enhanced antibody-dependent effector cell function.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized the pattern of Fc-receptor expression on CD14+ monocytic cells, mDC and NK cells across three different mucosal tissues associated with HIV-1 transmission. Overall, FcR expression levels were significantly lower in effector cells isolated from mucosal tissues than whole blood. The potential implication of the observed FcR expression patterns on the effectiveness of FcR-dependent cellular effector functions to impact on the initial events in mucosal transmission and dissemination warrants further mechanistic studies. To address these issues, inhibition of virus replication by antibody-dependent effector mechanisms in mucosal tissues <italic>ex vivo</italic> is currently being explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154656.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Raw data for Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154656.g001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154656.g005">5</xref> within this manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154656.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154656.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>A &#x00026; B.
