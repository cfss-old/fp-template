A priority for fundamental and clinical research, therefore, is to decipher the function of over 140 remaining orphan GPCRs. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's circadian pacemaker, governs daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology. Here we launch the SCN orphan GPCR project to (i) search for murine orphan GPCRs with enriched expression in the SCN, (ii) generate mutant animals deficient in candidate GPCRs, and (iii) analyse the impact on circadian rhythms. We thereby identify Gpr176 as an SCN-enriched orphan GPCR that sets the pace of circadian behaviour. Gpr176 is expressed in a circadian manner by SCN neurons, and molecular characterization reveals that it represses cAMP signalling in an agonist-independent manner. Gpr176 acts independently of, and in parallel to, the Vipr2 GPCR, not through the canonical Gi, but via the unique G-protein subclass Gz.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Most tissues outside the SCN also contain local clocks (the so-called peripheral clocks), and their rhythms are synchronized, harmoniously, by an array of direct or indirect signals from the SCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Thus, the SCN lies at the top of a hierarchical, multioscillator system distributed across the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, including sleep-wake disorder, tumorigenesis, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Drug efficacy and toxicity are also under circadian regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These lines of evidence support the potential value of developing drugs that target the circadian clock, and pioneer studies have already identified synthetic compounds that selectively target the key intracellular clock components, cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and REV-ERB&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Because their targets are distributed across the body, these compounds can modulate both the central and peripheral clocks equally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In contrast, the development of drugs that specifically target the SCN remains an unfulfilled opportunity for circadian pharmacology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of cell surface receptors, participating in a broad range of physiological functions. It has been appreciated that GPCRs are the most common target of pharmaceutical drugs: more than 30&#x00025; of clinically marketed drugs target GPCR function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Intriguingly, there are still &#x0003e;140 orphan GPCRs whose cognate ligands are not known, and deciphering their physiological function remains a priority for both clinical and fundamental research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We speculated that some orphan GPCRs, whose physiological functions have remained unknown, might exist in the SCN and function as potential modulators of the circadian system.</p><p>Structurally, GPCRs possess two different conformations, active and inactive. Agonists lock the receptor structure in its active form, antagonists block agonist action, and inverse agonists stabilize the receptor in its inactive form. In the absence of ligands, GPCRs spontaneously interchange between the two conformations; active and inactive, generating agonist-independent baseline activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Although the magnitude of this spontaneous activity differs strikingly between GPCRs, some of the orphan GPCRs exhibit significant levels of intrinsic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Depending on the type of G-protein to which the GPCR is coupled, a variety of downstream signalling pathways can be activated. Circadian fluctuation of cAMP signal is crucial for the maintenance of circadian clock function in the SCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In this context, the Vipr2 GPCR for vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) is a positive regulator of cAMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and demonstrated to be necessary for SCN time-keeping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Yet, much less is known about the molecular identity of GPCR that negatively regulates cAMP production in the SCN.</p><p>cAMP synthesis is positively or negatively regulated by Gs or Gi family members, respectively. While the Gs family contains two subtypes (Gs1 and Gs2), the inhibitory members include three Gi (Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3) and one Gz. All Gi members, except Gz, are substrates of pertussis toxin (PTX). PTX mediates ADP ribosylation at the carboxyl terminal cysteine residue (&#x02212;4 position), inhibiting Gi activity. Because Gz lacks this cysteine residue, it can inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in a PTX-insensitive manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Differing from Gi, Gz is expressed mainly in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, but its roles in the brain are not understood.</p><p>In the present study we surveyed all known orphan GPCRs expressed in the SCN, and identified three SCN-enriched genes: <italic>Gpr176</italic>, <italic>Gpr19</italic> and <italic>Calcr</italic>. We generated knockout mice for each of them and demonstrated that Gpr176 is a unique orphan GPCR that can set the pace of circadian behaviour. Gpr176 is expressed mainly in the brain, with prominent expression in the SCN, and its protein abundance fluctuates in a circadian fashion. Molecular characterization further revealed that this orphan receptor has an agonist-independent basal activity to repress cAMP production. Notably, the unique G-protein subclass Gz, but not the canonical Gi, is required for the activity of Gpr176. We show that Gpr176 (negative regulator of cAMP) acts independently of, and additively with, the Vipr2.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The SCN-orphan GPCR project identifies <italic>Gpr176</italic></title><p>We first constructed a list of GPCR genes that are potentially enriched in the SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

On the other hand, the remaining genes were either only faintly expressed in the SCN or located more broadly in the regions outside of the SCN.

Homozygous deletion of each of them did not cause any gross abnormalities, lethality or infertility, allowing for circadian locomotor activity tests on respective adult mutant mice. Animals were entrained on a 12-h light:12-h dark (LD) cycle for 2 weeks and then transferred to constant darkness (DD) to monitor the endogenous SCN-driven locomotor activity rhythm. We found that whereas <italic>Gpr176</italic>-deficient mice exhibited a significantly shorter circadian period compared with wild-type littermate mice, mice lacking <italic>Gpr19</italic> or <italic>Calcr</italic> did not show any significant difference in period by genotype (circadian periods (h), mean&#x000b1;s.e.m.

Importantly, <italic>Gpr176</italic> mutant mice that had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6J background over 10 generations also had a similarly short-period phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>; period (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> periodogram)&#x000b1;s.e.m: <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, 23.39&#x000b1;0.03&#x02009;h; <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>, 23.77&#x000b1;0.02&#x02009;h (<italic>n</italic>=12, both genotypes); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>Gpr176</italic>-deficient mice were normal for light-induced phase resetting; their resetting response to early- and late-night light pulses were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Thus, <italic>Gpr176</italic> is not likely to be a light signal-related receptor for the SCN. Rather, this orphan receptor appears to be involved in the determination of intrinsic period of the SCN.</p><p>To complement the data on circadian behaviour, we performed real-time bioluminescence imaging of cultured SCN slices from wild-type and <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice carrying a <italic>Per1</italic>-promoter-luciferase (<italic>Per1-luc</italic>) reporter gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). Crucially, bioluminescence rhythm of the <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> SCN slice had a shorter period than that of the wild-type control (<italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>=25.11&#x000b1;0.14&#x02009;h; <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>=24.39&#x000b1;0.16&#x02009;h; mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., <italic>n</italic>=4 for each, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, <italic>t</italic>-test); the short-period phenotype of behaviour is thus ascribable to the SCN. In contrast, the short period was not observed for their lung slices (<italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>=24.76&#x000b1;0.09&#x02009;h; <italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>=24.81&#x000b1;0.31&#x02009;h; <italic>n</italic>=4 for each), suggesting that the effect of <italic>Gpr176</italic> deficiency may be specific to the central oscillator.</p><p>Of note, northern blot analysis with different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>) revealed that <italic>Gpr176</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed chiefly in the brain. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization was therefore further conducted to map the neural expression from the forebrain to the medulla oblongata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Notably, the highest expression of <italic>Gpr176</italic> was observed within the SCN. Relatively strong and restricted expression was also seen in the subfornical organ (SFO), organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and cerebellar flocculus (Fl), among other regions, suggesting that <italic>Gpr176</italic> in extra-SCN sites may contribute to different brain functions that we have not yet systematically investigated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clock-controlled circadian expression of <italic>Gpr176</italic> in the SCN</title><p><italic>Gpr176</italic> encodes a class A orphan GPCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), whose <italic>in vivo</italic> function is unexplored. To further investigate its role in the circadian system, we profiled temporal expression of <italic>Gpr176</italic> in the SCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). To do this, we performed quantitative <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, using mice housed either in LD or DD, their brains being collected at 4-h intervals across 24-h cycles. Notably, in both LD and DD, the SCN had a time-of-day-specific expression of <italic>Gpr176</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). In LD, <italic>Gpr176</italic> was highest at night at ZT16 (ZT represents <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> time; ZT0 denotes lights-on and ZT12 lights-off) and lowest in the early morning at ZT0 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, peak versus trough, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test). Similarly, in DD, <italic>Gpr176</italic> was highest in the subjective night at CT16 (CT represents circadian time; CT0 denotes the beginning of the subjective day and CT12 the beginning of the subjective night) and lowest in the subjective morning at CT4 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, peak versus trough). Furthermore, we found that the subjective-night peak expression of <italic>Gpr176</italic> was severely damped in mice deficient in the core clock components <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>, which completely lack a functional circadian clock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), indicating that the SCN clockwork controls <italic>Gpr176</italic> gene expression. A light pulse given at night did not cause any acute change in <italic>Gpr176</italic> expression in the SCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus the SCN appears to direct <italic>Gpr176</italic> expression independently of light.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characteristic distribution of Gpr176 across the whole SCN</title><p>We developed an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against Gpr176 and performed immunohistochemistry.

Agonist-independent constitutive function has been assigned to a number of orphan GPCRs. Thus, in the absence of a known ligand, we looked for a constitutive action or influence of Gpr176 on Vip&#x02013;Vipr2-mediated signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We employed the Flp-In TREx293 cell system and established a clonal cell line that expressed Vipr2 constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, middle) and Gpr176 in a doxycycline-dependent, inducible manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, upper; see Methods for details). Confocal microscopy revealed markedly increased plasma membrane-localized immunofluorescence of Gpr176 in induced cells. On the other hand, constant membrane localization was observed for Vipr2.</p><p>Induction of Gpr176 led to an attenuation of Vip&#x02013;Vipr2-mediated cAMP signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>): Vip-promoted cAMP accumulation was significantly reduced by doxycycline treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, versus nontreatment control) at any of the dosages of Vip used for stimulation (100, 10, and 1&#x02009;nM). This was not due to a difference in cell viability or cell number between doxycycline- and control-treated groups, the growth rate of the cells being equivalent in the two groups. Furthermore, we assayed the same number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) resuspending 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> viable cells in serum-free assay buffer for stimulation with Vip.</p><p>Neither plasma membrane localization nor total protein amount of Vipr2 changed appreciably with doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Moreover, <sup>125</sup>I-labelled Vip binding was almost identical between doxycycline-treated and non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Thus, attenuation of Vip signalling by Gpr176 induction is likely to arise from changes in the downstream pathway. In accordance with this notion, forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was also blunted by the induction of Gpr176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Forskolin is a cell-permeable drug that directly activates adenylyl cyclases. Thus, the mode of action of Gpr176 does not necessarily depend on the integrity of Vip&#x02013;Vipr2. Consistent with this, Gpr176 exhibited similar basal activity when expressed alone in Flp-In TREx293 cells without concomitant expression of Vipr2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><p>Contrasting to the overt effect on cAMP, induction of Gpr176 did not bring about any significant change in inositol phosphate IP<sub>1</sub> formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>).

Generally, this motif is important for coupling of GPCRs to the partner G-proteins. We thus wondered whether this motif is required for generation of the basal activity of Gpr176. In other GPCRs, including the related orphan receptor Gpr161 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) as well as the other class A non-orphan GPCRs such as Cxcr1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and Adra1b (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) a single point mutation of the valine residue located following the DRY triplet sequence led to a drastic loss of the receptor-mediated signalling. We therefore established a mutant Gpr176 inducible cell line where the homologous valine of this protein was mutated to arginine (V145R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Notably, regardless of the type of stimuli (Vip or forskolin), mutant Gpr176 did not yield any noticeable reduction of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), although the induction of protein levels was similar to that of the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), suggesting that the V145R mutation blocks Gpr176 activity. As an alternative mutation, the DRY sequence was changed to RDY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, but this mutation caused a loss of detectable Gpr176 expression and as a result no associated cAMP reduction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Thus, the DRYxxV motif seems important for both protein activity and stability of Gpr176. We generated additional mutants on the DRY triplet sequence and tested their activities using a cAMP GloSensor assay, and the results further support this conclusion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>Pertussis toxin (PTX) has been widely used to test the involvement of Gi signalling.

Gene knockout studies of candidate genes of interest revealed that Gpr176 is an SCN-enriched orphan GPCR required for normal circadian behaviour. Nearly all SCN neurons express Gpr176, and its abundance fluctuates in a circadian manner. Molecular characterization revealed that this orphan receptor has an agonist-independent basal activity to repress cAMP production. Notably, the unique G-protein subclass Gz, but not the canonical Gi, is required for the activity of Gpr176.</p><p>In the SCN, Gpr176 colocalizes with Vipr2. Given this overlapping expression, together with the ability of Gpr176 to compete with the Vip&#x02013;Vipr2&#x02013;cAMP signal, we surmise that the nighttime cAMP repression mediated by Gpr176 may serve as a part of the cAMP repressing mechanism that could counteract the Vip-Vipr2 axis in the SCN. As an additional feature of importance, Gpr176 is expressed mainly in the brain, with prominent expression in the SCN. This region specificity suggests that, as a putative target for circadian therapeutics, Gpr176 might possess the advantage of specificity, compared with broadly expressed neurotransmitter receptors, clock gene products and general modulators of second-messenger signalling such as phosphodiesterases. Thus, the results not only reveal a new signalling module, Gpr176/Gz, in the control of SCN circadian time-keeping, but also provide, thereby, a new class of GPCR signalling as a potential drug target to modulate the central clock in the brain.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on genes enriched in the SCN. The rationale for this tissue-specific approach is, first, the SCN is responsible for circadian behaviour, the ultimate and definitive arbiter of daily life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Second, we considered that specificity for local mechanisms is required because the SCN differs from the peripheral clocks in phasing. In rodents, for example, the molecular clockwork of the SCN phase-leads that of peripheral clocks by 7 to 11&#x02009;h (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Any drug targeting common circadian mechanisms would be able to affect or reset all the clocks simultaneously, and this might be deleterious for keeping the adaptive phasic order between the tissues (unless such drugs were to be delivered to the target tissue selectively&#x02014;a very demanding regimen). We thus reasoned that pursuing the molecular mechanisms that underpin the specificity of the SCN would be a valuable alternative way to search for potential drug targets in the central clock. Third, and last, the SCN-GENE selection strategy can be biased for &#x02018;druggable' targets. In the current study we found Gpr176 by focusing on the GPCR family, but the project readily lends itself to other target categories, for example, ion channels, suggesting the continued relevance of this screening method, in conjunction with others, for the discovery of clock gene modulators in the SCN.</p><p>Agonist-independent basal activity has been observed for a number of &#x02018;physiologically relevant' orphan GPCRs: for example, Gpr3, an orphan GPCR endowed with constitutive Gs signalling activity, protects oocytes from ageing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and modulates amyloid-&#x003b2; production in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The orphan receptor Gpr161, which participates in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling during neural tube development, also displays constitutive activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Agonist- independent intrinsic activity is also implicated in non-orphan GPCRs' physiological function. The odorant receptors (ORs), which are GPCRs, possess an intrinsic activity and&#x02014;in the absence of activating odorant&#x02014;regulate axonal projection of olfactory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Thus, by analogous inference, intrinsic activity of Gpr176 could underlie its effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, there may be no endogenous ligand, in which case the main regulatory control of activity would be via the level of protein expression, which for Gpr176 was highly circadian in the SCN. Consistent with its negative effect on cAMP, Gpr176 protein increased at night, a phase when cAMP levels in the SCN were decreased to the circadian nadir levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The absence of Gpr176, in turn, led to reduced suppression of cAMP level in the night, supporting the hypothesis. Nevertheless, the presence of unidentified endogenous ligands is always difficult to exclude for receptors with constitutive action. In this respect, it is worth noting that even without a known natural ligand, surrogate ligands can be developed for the orphan GPCRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, highlighting the druggable feature of this protein family.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of cAMP synthesis in the SCN leads to longer circadian period of behavioural rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.

However, the mechanism(s) through which the circadian fluctuation of cAMP signal is integrated to the core clock machinery is still unclear in the literature and needs further exploration.

These data raise the possibility of potential compensatory mechanisms, perhaps through alternative GPCRs in the SCN, as previously suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. A complete understanding of circadian regulation of cAMP signalling in the SCN, and of the concerted roles of Gpr176 (repressor) and Vipr2 (activator) will be a challenge of future study.</p><p>Unlike Gi, Gz does not serve as a substrate for PTX because the consensus cysteine residue in the fourth position from the C terminus of Gi proteins is replaced with isoleucine. We showed that Gpr176 links preferentially to Gz. It is generally considered that Gz shares the same receptor coupling profile with the Gi subtypes, but there are some exceptions. For example, Smoothened (smo), which is an orphan G-protein-linked seven-transmembrane protein that mediates Hedgehog signalling, has been shown to activate Gz more drastically than Gi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.

Of interest, this C-terminal cytosolic region is highly conserved among <italic>Gpr176</italic> genes in different species, yet does not show homology to any other annotated protein sequences, thus implying a unique feature characterizing this GPCR. Within its seven transmembrane domains, Gpr176 does not have an aspartic acid at position 2.50 (BW numbering), a feature also rarely observed for class A GPCRs. Understanding how these structural features affect molecular functions of Gpr176 will be a topic of future study.</p><p>In summary, we described here that Gpr176 is an SCN-enriched orphan GPCR that can set the pace of circadian behaviour. This is the first report to assign a function of this orphan receptor in physiology. We revealed that Gpr176 is a previously uncharacterized Gz-linked orphan GPCR that bears intrinsic activity to reduce cAMP production. The discovery of the functional orphan GPCR with a novel mode of action within the SCN would be of help to understand the mechanism that underpins the SCN and thereby facilitate searching for a potential specific drug target to modulate the central clock.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Gpr176</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Acc.
