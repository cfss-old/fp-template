Lymphocyte development requires a multi-step process whereby common lymphoid progenitors differentiate into B and T lineage-specific cells <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Developmental control of early B lineage cell differentiation is exerted by a regulatory network of key transcription factors <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Sequential actions of these transcription factors results in the multi-step differentiation of mature B-cells from immature progenitors in the bone marrow <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Recombinant inbred (RI) mouse stains are a significant resource for leukemia gene discovery <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These mice harbor somatic viral insertions that alter the expression of tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Sites of proviral insertion that are common to many animals within a strain or between multiple strains identify genomic locations where proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes reside. The RI strain AKXD-27 possessed B-lineage lymphomas with a common proviral insertion site, designated as ecotropic viral integration site 3 (<italic>Evi3</italic>) <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Within the AKXD-27 strain 70% of mice exhibiting pre-B cell and B-cell tumors contained proviral insertions at the <italic>Evi3</italic> locus; no rearrangements at the <italic>Evi3</italic> locus were found in either T-cell or myeloid tumors <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The high frequency of B-lineage lymphoma in mice with a proviral insertion at the <italic>Evi3</italic> locus suggests that proviral insertion alters the expression of genes near the insertion site to promote B-lineage lymphoma.</p><p>Analysis of the genomic region surrounding the <italic>Evi3</italic> retroviral integration site revealed that the virus had inserted upstream of a previously uncharacterized gene, which encodes a 30-zinc-finger protein with predicted DNA-binding and protein interaction domains <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This gene was found to be up-regulated in tumors with retroviral insertions at Evi3, due to the strong viral promoters driving endogenous gene expression <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The human ortholog of this gene, <italic>EHZF</italic>, was identified due to its specific expression in CD34<sup>+</sup> early hematopoietic progenitor stem cells <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Due to its zinc finger motifs, the gene at the <italic>Evi3</italic> insertion site has been renamed <italic>Zfp521</italic> in mice and <italic>ZNF521</italic> in humans.</p><p>Although studies on the molecular function of <italic>Zfp521</italic> have revealed a role in transcriptional regulation via chromatin remodeling <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, its place within the transcriptional network regulating B-cell differentiation remains unclear. To better understand the role of <italic>Zfp521</italic> in B-lymphocytes, we developed a knockdown system in the lymphoblast cell line BCL1, which secretes IgD and IgM antibodies <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We assayed B-cell gene expression in this system, and found that certain genes which were up-regulated in B-cell tumors from AKXD-27 mice with <italic>Evi3</italic> retroviral insertions <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> were conversely down-regulated in <italic>Zfp521</italic> knockdown cells. Knocking down <italic>Zfp521</italic> resulted in decreased cellular viability and increased cellular apoptosis. Using a cell viability rescue assay, we identified <italic>cyclin D1</italic> as a potential mediator of increased B-cell proliferation in <italic>Zfp521</italic> over-expressing leukemias, and propose a position for <italic>Zfp521</italic> within the B-cell differentiation transcriptional regulatory network.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse lymphoblast cells (BCL1; ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TIB-197) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2&#x000a0;mM L-glutamine (Lonza), 0.05&#x000a0;mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 15% FBS, 5% penicillin, 5% streptomycin at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title><italic>Zfp521</italic> shRNA constructs</title><p>shRNA constructs were purchased from OriGene (OriGene Technologies: SR422637).

Due to the increased numbers of B-cells in mice with <italic>Zfp521</italic> over-expression, we postulated that <italic>Zfp521</italic> may function during B-cell development to regulate B-cell viability or proliferation. Additionally, the finding that mice with <italic>Zfp521</italic> over-expression have an inappropriate B-cell surface marker profile, with upregulation of markers expressed from the pro-B stage of differentiation <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, raises the possibility that <italic>Zfp521</italic> functions as part of the B-cell transcription factor network to promote differentiation events.</p><p>The results from our <italic>Zfp521</italic> knockdown culture system are consistent with the above hypotheses. We discovered that BCL1 cell viability is reduced and apoptosis is significantly increased when <italic>Zfp521</italic> is knocked down, suggesting a role for <italic>Zfp521</italic> in B-cell survival. Our results support a role for <italic>Zfp521</italic> in the regulation of genes expressed from the Pro-B-stage onwards. These results are consistent with the findings from a recent study reporting a role for <italic>Zfp521</italic> in regulation of the pre-B-cell receptor genes <italic>BTK</italic>, <italic>BANK1</italic>, and <italic>BLNK</italic>
<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moderate levels of <italic>ZNF521</italic> expression have also been noted in the human Raji (pre-B) cell line <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Retroviral insertion at the <italic>Evi3</italic> locus causing <italic>Zfp521</italic> over-expression is a cooperative event in the development of acute B-lineage leukemia in mice expressing an E2A-HLF chimeric protein associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia t(17;19) <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The tumors in these mice are of the B-progenitor type, and express B220 and Cd19, similar to tumors found in AKXD27 mice with retroviral insertions at the <italic>Evi3</italic> locus <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Further studies revealed <italic>ZNF521</italic> overexpression in human leukemic cell lines with t(17;19) translocations <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, suggesting that the mechanism by which over-expression of <italic>Zfp521/ZNF521</italic> causes B-cell leukemia may be conserved between mouse and human. Transgenic mice that over-express both the <italic>E2A-HLF</italic> fusion gene and <italic>Zfp521</italic> showed increased proliferation of B-cell progenitors <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our study suggests that the increased proliferation found in <italic>Zpf521</italic> over-expressing Pro-B-cells is mediated by <italic>cyclin D1</italic>.

The B-cell genes <italic>Ebf1</italic>, <italic>Pax5</italic>, and <italic>Mb1</italic> were also up-regulated in these knockdown cultures <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is possible that knocking down <italic>Zfp521</italic> at the Pro-B-cell stage has an opposite effect to its knockdown in progenitor cells. Knockdown of <italic>Zfp521</italic> at the Pre-B-cell stage also reduces cell proliferation <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, similar to our findings at the Pro-B-cell stage. Notably, in Pro-B-cell tumours with <italic>Evi3</italic> retroviral insertions, <italic>Zfp521</italic> over-expression occurs concomittantly with <italic>Ebf1</italic>, <italic>Pax5</italic>, and <italic>Mb1</italic> over-expression, suggesting that <italic>Zfp521</italic> has a positive effect on the transcription of these B-cell factors at the Pro-B-cell stage <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We therefore propose that Zfp521 functions within the B-cell transcriptional network to promote differentiation events subsequent to the Pro-B-cell stage of lineage commitment. Further study is needed to determine how perturbations of Zfp521 function at different stages of B-cell development disrupt the balance of gene expression patterns and cellular activities to culminate in leukemic transformation of B-lineage cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec0100"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shlush</surname><given-names>L.I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Minden</surname><given-names>M.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preleukemia the normal side of cancer</article-title><source>Curr.
