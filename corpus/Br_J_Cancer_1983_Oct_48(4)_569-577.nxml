The effects were similar on tumours of high and of low colonisation potentials. Neuraminidase and hyaluronidase did not exert any effect on metastatic colonisation potential, although all 3 enzymes were shown to be active and specific in cleaving their purified substrates, under the conditions in which they were used on the cells. Trypsin and neuraminidase were also shown to release characteristic components from the surfaces of living tumour cells, although hyaluronidase did not release detectable quantities of N-acetyl glucosamine indicating that there is little hyaluronic acid-related mucopolysaccharide on the surface of these mammary tumour cells. The results provide direct evidence suggesting that surface protein composition exerts an effect on the metastatic colonisation capability of mammary tumour cells.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0107-a" xlink:role="575"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0108-a" xlink:role="576"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="569" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="570" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="571" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="572" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="573" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="574" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="575" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="576" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00421-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="577" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
