We developed a new approach for analysis of PCR amplicons based on restriction endonuclease digestion. The first stage of the restriction enzyme assay is hybridization of a target DNA to immobilized complementary oligonucleotide probes that carry a molecular marker, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). At the second stage, a target-specific restriction enzyme is added, cleaving the target-probe duplex at the corresponding restriction site and releasing the HRP marker into solution, where it is quantified colorimetrically. The assay was tested for detection of the methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) pathogen, using the <italic>mecA</italic> gene as a target. Calibration curves indicated that the limit of detection for both target oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon was approximately 1 nM. Sequences of target oligonucleotides were altered to demonstrate that (i) any mutation of the restriction site reduced the signal to zero; (ii) double and triple point mutations of sequences flanking the restriction site reduced restriction to 50&#x02013;80% of the positive control; and (iii) a minimum of a 16-bp target-probe dsDNA hybrid was required for significant cleavage. Further experiments showed that the assay could detect the <italic>mecA</italic> amplicon from an unpurified PCR mixture with detection limits similar to those with standard fluorescence-based qPCR. Furthermore, addition of a large excess of heterologous genomic DNA did not affect amplicon detection. Specificity of the assay is very high because it involves two biorecognition steps. The proposed assay is low-cost and can be completed in less than 1 hour. Thus, we have demonstrated an efficient new approach for pathogen detection and amplicon genotyping in conjunction with various end-point and qPCR applications. The restriction enzyme assay may also be used for parallel analysis of multiple different amplicons from the same unpurified mixture in broad-range PCR applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This publication was made possible by NPRP 5-593-3-149 grant from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation.

PCR-amplified DNA targets of interest (amplicons) may be quantified either simultaneously with DNA synthesis as in quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), or after completion as in end-point applications. A large number of methods are used for amplicon detection, most involving fluorogenic-based systems and complex instrumentation. Other approaches have been developed, including electrochemical detection of amplicons in a microarray-based format <xref rid="pone.0097826-Ghindilis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, surface plasmon resonance, sandwich hybridization assays (SHAs) or the fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) test <xref rid="pone.0097826-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Lazcka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Direct DNA sequencing can also be used for amplicon characterization. However, it is still a relatively expensive and time-consuming approach. Thus, qPCR applications are significantly more expensive than many conventional techniques, such as culturing and immunoassays <xref rid="pone.0097826-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, many conventional methods provide for simultaneous detection of multiple organisms of interest together with pathogen characterization and genotyping <xref rid="pone.0097826-Levi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In contrast, PCR has proven to be challenging to multiplex because of both primer and probe design concerns. As a result, several modules for amplicon characterization are required, further increasing costs. Amplicon genotyping is especially important for pathogen detection in complex environmental microbial communities. An attractive approach involves the use of &#x02018;universal&#x02019; primers (designed from conserved sequences) to generate a mixed population of amplicons (&#x02018;broad-ranged PCR&#x02019;) <xref rid="pone.0097826-Evertsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This approach, however, requires the development of additional, low-cost and rapid techniques to analyze the resulting mixture of PCR products simultaneously <xref rid="pone.0097826-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>We developed a novel amplicon genotyping technique, and have tested the approach for detection of an important pathogen: methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections with an estimated annual impact between 12,000 and 18,650 patient deaths per year, 2.7 million extended hospitals days and $9.5 billion excess costs, in the United States alone <xref rid="pone.0097826-Noskin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Klevens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This pathogen developed resistance to penicillin and newer &#x003b2;-lactam antimicrobial drugs (<italic>e.g.</italic> methicillin), and as a result MRSA epidemics have spread widely in hospitals and throughout ordinary community settings (for a review see <xref rid="pone.0097826-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). The pathogen was also recently isolated from marine water and intertidal beach sand from US West Coast public marine beaches <xref rid="pone.0097826-Soge1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Similarity between the environmental strains and hospital pathogens suggested that public beaches may serve as reservoirs for transmission of MRSA to beach visitors, and for exchange of antibiotic resistance genes among staphylococci and related genera <xref rid="pone.0097826-Soge1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Current MRSA screening is based on a combination of culturing, qPCR-based assays and coagulase tests to determine genotype and strain characteristics of the pathogen <xref rid="pone.0097826-Soge1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Huletsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Kondo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. MRSA-specific gene targets are located on a mobile genetic element, the Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0097826-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). The main target for qPCR assays, the <italic>mecA</italic> gene, is responsible for the antibiotic resistance phenotype, and encodes a peptidoglycan transpeptidase which functions in cell wall biosynthesis when the three other essential transpeptidases have been inactivated by &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics <xref rid="pone.0097826-Soge1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Huletsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Kondo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Hanssen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Jonas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recent studies showed high sensitivity of qPCR-based methods used for <italic>mecA</italic> detection, <italic>i.e.</italic> the IDI-MRSA kit (GeneOhm Sciences Canada, Ste-Foy, QC, Canada) and GenoType MRSA Direct (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) <xref rid="pone.0097826-vanHal1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-Desjardins1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition to classical qPCR, novel methods are being developed, including a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which is a next-generation emulsion-based endpoint PCR assay <xref rid="pone.0097826-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The main focus of using PCR for MRSA screening is to reduce the assay turnaround time to 2&#x02013;4 h (from 24&#x02013;48 h required for culturing techniques), which in turn could drastically decrease the incidence of MRSA disease due to fast decision making in hospital settings <xref rid="pone.0097826-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Several factors complicate the PCR applications, including high genetic variability and continuous emergence of new MRSA strains, and the presence of cross-reactive sequences in methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, such as <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Thus, the ability to perform extensive pathogen genotyping of multiple loci is crucial. Otherwise, the standard culturing methods are still considered necessary for confirmation of qPCR results <xref rid="pone.0097826-Desjardins1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>We describe a new approach for amplicon detection and genotyping based on specific enzymatic digestion of a target DNA. Enzymatic digestion with RNase H was previously proposed for detection of the <italic>mecA</italic> gene using a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay referred to as &#x0201c;cycling probe technology&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0097826-Bekkaoui1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Our approach is based on the selective cleavage reaction performed by restriction endonucleases, namely Class II restrictases. These enzymes have nearly absolute sequence specificity for a particular double-stranded (ds) DNA sequence (typically, a palindromic site composed of two equivalent half-sites with the total length of 4&#x02013;8 bp) <xref rid="pone.0097826-Pingoud1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097826-JenJacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Restriction enzymes use linear diffusion or &#x0201c;sliding&#x0201d; to move along a DNA duplex, with cleavage occurring only when the protein&#x02013;DNA interface is correctly assembled at the proper recognition site <xref rid="pone.0097826-Pingoud1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Previously, these enzymes have been used for characterization of PCR amplicons, generating a unique pattern of DNA fragments to serve as a fingerprint when gel electrophoresis is performed (see <xref rid="pone.0097826-Wolk1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). Our assay does not require gel electrophoresis, and it has only two main steps: the first is hybridization of the target DNA (<italic>i.e.</italic> an amplicon) to immobilized complementary oligonucleotide probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The immobilized probes carry a molecular marker, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), attached to the end of the oligonucleotide that is free in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g001">Fig. 1A, E</xref>). After completion of the target-probe hybridization, the second step involves the addition of a target-specific restriction enzyme, which cleaves the DNA duplex and releases the HRP marker into solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The release can only occur if the target binds to the probe, which results in creation of the cognate site for recognition and restriction by the enzyme <xref rid="pone.0097826-JenJacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. With cleavage, one HRP molecule is released per each target molecule. Upon assay completion (5 to 60 min), the reaction mixture is transferred to a detection chamber for colorimetric quantitation of the released HRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Because this assay involves two biorecognition steps, which are (i) target-probe DNA duplex formation; and (ii) subsequent sequence-specific cleavage of the duplex by a restriction enzyme, it is advantageous compared to standard amplicon detection techniques with respect to increased specificity and significantly reduced probability of false positives. Furthermore, it does not require expensive fluorescent reagents, instead relying on a variety of standard HRP substrates that can be used in a multitude of low cost detection formats. In its current application, this technique can be coupled with end-point PCR, and/or used in a near real-time format for amplicon detection and quantitation.</p><fig id="pone-0097826-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0097826.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>General schematic of the restriction enzyme assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface immobilization of HRP conjugated to an oligonucleotide probe specific for a target gene of interest.

The strain TCH1516 (USA300-HOU-MR) originated as a clinical isolate from an adolescent patient with severe sepsis syndrome, and was classified as sequence type 8 (ST8) <xref rid="pone.0097826-Highlander1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The <italic>mecA</italic> amplicon (196 bp) was generated as described in the literature <xref rid="pone.0097826-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, using the primers: MCA-For, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGCAATATTACCGCACCTCA-3&#x02032;</named-content> (starting at position 1644 of <italic>mecA</italic> gene alignment), and MCA-Rev, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GTCTGCCACTTTCTCCTTGT-3&#x02032;</named-content> (starting at position 1820).

PCR was performed using one cycle of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, annealing at 55&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 90 sec, with the final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. Aliquots of amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for the presence of a single band of 196 bp. When necessary, the amplicon was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and DNA concentrations were measured with a NanoDrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer with the PicoGreen reagent (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Real-time qPCR</title><p>Real-time qPCR was conducted using a MyiQ Real-Time qPCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture was combined from 12.5 &#x000b5;L of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.25 &#x000b5;L of both forward and reverse primers (20 &#x000b5;M), 0.01 to 1 ng of template DNA and nuclease-free water to a total reaction volume of 25 &#x000b5;L. The thermocycling was performed as described above. Negative controls were run using nuclease-free water in place of template. Melting curves were visually inspected to check for a single peak at the expected melting temperature using MyiQ software, (v. 1.0.410, BioRad, USA). After PCR completion, the amplicon presence was detected by gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>HRP conjugation to oligonucleotide probes</title><p>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) was activated for conjugation by introducing maleimide groups with the sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC) reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to a published technique <xref rid="pone.0097826-Dill1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> with some modifications. The reaction was carried out in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (diluted from 10X stock solution (Ambion/Thermo Fisher Scientific)). First, 100 &#x000b5;L of 2 mg/mL HRP solution in PBS was treated with 5 &#x000b5;L of 10 mg/mL (23 mM) Sulfo-SMCC solution in dimethylformamide (DMF). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, and then applied twice to Micro Bio-Spin columns with Bio-Gel P-6 (P-6 column) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to remove the excess of Sulfo-SMCC.</p><p>To make sure of the reduced state of thiol groups on the 3&#x02032; end of the probe MCA-BG the oligonucleotides were treated using dithiothreitol (DTT) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In total, 100 &#x000b5;L of 10 &#x000b5;M oligonucleotide solution in nuclease-free water was treated with 4 &#x000b5;L of 500 mM DTT solution in water, and then incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction mixture was purified from the excess of DTT by applying twice to P-6 columns (Bio-Rad).</p><p>Finally, we mixed together equal volumes (90 &#x000b5;L each) of the purified SH-modified oligonucleotide solution and activated HRP, and incubated the reaction at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The resultant HRP-oligonucleotide conjugate, MCA-BG-HRP contained 5 &#x000b5;M oligonucleotide concentration with an excess of unbound HRP. The preparation was used directly for surface immobilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Restriction enzyme assay protocol</title><p>For surface immobilization of the HRP-probe through streptavidin-biotin interactions, 30 &#x000b5;L of 50 nM dilution of MCA-BG-HRP conjugate in PBS (1&#x02236;100 dilution of 5 &#x000b5;M stock) was applied to each well of a streptavidin-pre-coated 96-microwell plate (Thermo Scientific). The plate was incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, and then washed extensively at room temperature to remove all unbound HRP and conjugate: 6 times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), followed by 2 times with PBS.</p><p>For target hybridization to the surface-immobilized HRP-probes, working solutions of target oligonucleotides (0&#x02013;100 nM) were prepared in PBS. The positive control was the fully complementary target 40-mer, and negative control was PBS without oligonucleotides added. Test and control target solutions were added to the wells (20 &#x000b5;L per well) coated with the HRP-probes. Hybridization was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02013;60 min with gentle shaking (100 rpm), and unbound targets were removed by washing 6X with PBST and 2X with PBS.</p><p>Purified amplicons were diluted in PBS as described above for oligonucleotide targets. To use unpurified dsDNA amplicons, the PCR reaction mixture was collected either at the end-point or at an intermediate cycle during PCR. Serial dilutions were made using the pre-cycling PCR mixture (containing the primers and template, but no amplicon). When required, the heterologous mouse genomic DNA (kindly provided by Dr. R. Stephen Lloyd, OHSU) was added as the last step to each dilution, at 100 ng per well.</p><p>The test samples containing dsDNA targets (both purified amplicons and whole PCR mixtures) were denatured by heating at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min followed by incubation on ice for 2 min, and then immediately added to the wells coated with the HRP conjugate for target-probe hybridization. Hybridization was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min with gentle shaking (100 rpm), and unbound targets were removed by washing as described above for oligonucleotide targets.</p><p>The restriction enzyme cleavage of the hybridized target-probe dsDNA was done using 20 &#x000b5;L of the reaction mixture per well. The mixture contained 1&#x02236;10 dilution of 10X NEBuffer 3 in nuclease-free water and 0.5 U/&#x000b5;L (1&#x02236;20 dilution of the stock) of <italic>Bgl</italic>II restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The restriction protocol recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) was used with the omission of bovine serum albumin (BSA) from the reaction mixture (since BSA presence is known to increase the HRP substrate oxidation background).

Conversely, multiple SNP-based allelic variations may be detected using several probes, with the SNP sites positioned close to the solution end of the target-probe duplex to achieve maximum effect on the HRP signal.</p><p>Our data indicated that a minimum of 16-bp target-probe dsDNA duplex was required for significant cleavage (30&#x02013;50% relative to the positive control), with shorter targets producing no signal. This result suggested the assay has very high specificity, because on average in a random DNA sequence, a cognate 16-mer would be observed only once every 4.3 Gbp. Further experiments showed that the exact position of the restriction site within the target-probe duplex did not affect the HRP signal significantly, as long as the site was located 3 or more nucleotides away from the end. Taken together, our experiments defined the restriction enzyme assay requirements for target and probe design. The results indicated that the restriction enzyme assay is highly specific and will be useful for detection of allelic variation in pathogens or other organisms of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Use of the restriction enzyme assay for detection of PCR products</title><p>The optimized assay was also used for detection of PCR amplicons. Since amplicons were double-stranded, a denaturation step was required to separate the target and anti-sense strands. Overall, the maximum HRP signal was about an order of magnitude lower for the amplicon compared to the single-stranded oligonucleotide target. Presumably, this decrease occurred because the competing process of strand re-association reduced the amount of target strand available for hybridization to the probe. Nevertheless, the same limit of detection (1 nM) was observed for both ds amplicons and oligonucleotide targets. Importantly, amplicon purification was unnecessary, as our data showed no difference when we used the purified <italic>mecA</italic> amplicon or the unpurified PCR mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This is consistent with the commercial manufacturer's suggestions that many restriction enzymes may be fully active in a PCR mixture, and therefore suitable for direct use (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche-applied-science.com/shop/products/restriction-enzymes-technical-tips">http://www.roche-applied-science.com/shop/products/restriction-enzymes-technical-tips</ext-link>).</p><p>Addition of a large (approximately 10X) excess of heterologous (mouse) genomic DNA to the PCR mixture containing the <italic>mecA</italic> amplicon did not affect the restriction enzyme assay performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097826-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). There may have even been some improvement over results without heterologous DNA additions, especially at low amplicon concentrations, which could be attributed to a decrease in strand re-association by the presence of heterologous DNA <xref rid="pone.0097826-Huss1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The restriction enzyme assay was also used to follow amplicon formation during PCR thermocycling in near real-time. PCR cycling thresholds were similar between the restriction enzyme assay and the standard fluorescence-based qPCR detection assay. Thus, the restriction enzyme assay may be used in a semi-quantitative format to evaluate PCR product formation, with parallel genotyping and detection of multiple different amplicons from the same unpurified PCR mixture.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Currently, over 3000 Class II restrictases have been discovered, and approximately 300 are available commercially (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases">https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases</ext-link>). This large collection enables rapid selection of a specific restriction enzyme for practically any relatively long (&#x0003e;100 bp) target of interest. Our experiments provided a defined algorithm for probe design and subsequent testing of a restriction enzyme-probe pair. The amplicon restriction enzyme assay is fast and simple, requiring only target hybridization followed by restriction cleavage, which can be achieved in under 1 hour. The detection costs are lower than those of qPCR, since no fluorescent reagents are used. In the future, detection can be achieved using an electrochemical format simply by changing HRP substrates. The restriction enzyme assays have extremely high selectivity due to the requirement for two biorecognition steps, and thus are able to detect specific sequences in the presence of excess of heterologous DNA. Therefore, the assay can be used for amplicon genotyping in conjunction with various end-point and qPCR applications. Addition of restriction enzyme assays can allow for fast, electrophoresis-free detection and quantification of multiple different genes from the same PCR mixture generated in broad-range PCR. Furthermore, the relative ease of assay design and optimization will facilitate use of the restriction enzyme assay for the genotyping of emerging microbial pathogens.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0097826-Wolk1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wolk</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name> (<year>2001</year>) <article-title>Principles of molecular microbiology testing methods</article-title>. <source>Infectious Disease Clinics of North America</source>
