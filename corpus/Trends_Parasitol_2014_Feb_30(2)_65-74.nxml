Among the manifestations of leishmaniasis, post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL; see <xref rid="glo0005" ref-type="glossary">Glossary</xref>) caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, is possibly the most intriguing clinically and scientifically, as it generally develops as a sequela after apparent successful cure from visceral leishmaniasis (VL; also known as kala-azar) <xref rid="bib0005 bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. The clinical presentation of VL and PKDL differ substantially; in VL, patients suffer from prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and anaemia, whereas manifestations of PKDL are limited to macular, papular, or nodular lesions in the skin <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. PKDL is confined to two geographically distinct zones, namely South Asia (India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) and East Africa, mainly Sudan <xref rid="bib0010 bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. In the South Asian variant, polymorphic lesions (coexistence of macules/patches along with papulonodules) are prevalent, whereas the Sudanese variant has papular or nodular lesions. Although mortality from PKDL is low, it is a stigmatizing disease that carries a significant socioeconomic burden, further amplified by a reluctance to obtain treatment or due to noncompliance. Lesions, especially the papulonodules, are parasite-rich, driving speculation that PKDL plays a pivotal role in the inter-epidemic transmission of VL.</p><p>Understanding the clinico-epidemiological aspects of PKDL would help define strategies for controlling VL, by providing further insights into <italic>L. donovani</italic> transmission dynamics. Most epidemiological studies with PKDL have reported no gender bias <xref rid="bib0020 bib0025 bib0030 bib0035 bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[4&#x02013;8]</xref>, a notable exception being studies from our group where a male predominance was reported <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The age distribution of PKDL in South Asia and Sudan also differs, as in the former, young adults are more affected whereas in the latter, children are more affected <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A lag period ranging from 2 to 10 years exists between cure from VL and onset of PKDL, suggesting that PKDL echoes the epidemic of VL and can persist well after the epidemic. This is supported by an epidemiological study in Bangladesh where it was noted that the incidence of PKDL showed a steep rise from 1 case per 10&#x000a0;000 in 2002&#x02013;2004 to 21 cases per 10&#x000a0;000 in 2007 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In India, the incidence of VL peaked in 1992 and a smaller rise was reported in 2007 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/INDIA.pdf" id="intr0005">http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/INDIA.pdf</ext-link>). Therefore, extrapolating from the Bangladesh experience, the incidence of PKDL in India may well see a sharp rise in coming years. In South Asia, transmission of VL is anthroponotic, whereas in Sudan, it is zoonotic and anthroponotic; therefore, patients with PKDL are the proposed disease reservoir of VL in India <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Accordingly, eradication of PKDL should be an essential component of the current VL elimination programme in South Asia that aims to bring down the annual incidence of VL to less than 1 per 10&#x000a0;000 population at a district or sub-district level by the end of 2015 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tdr/publications/documents/kala_azar_indicators.pdf" id="intr0010">http://www.who.int/tdr/publications/documents/kala_azar_indicators.pdf</ext-link>). To achieve this goal, a greater understanding of the cause(s) of PKDL is essential. Many excellent reviews have covered the epidemiology, immunopathology, diagnosis, and treatment of PKDL; <xref rid="tb0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> summarise our current knowledge of the immune responses observed in PKDL <xref rid="bib0010 bib0020 bib0055 bib0060 bib0065 bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[2,4,11&#x02013;14]</xref>. Information regarding the aetiopathogenesis of PKDL is limited and, therefore, no consensus has emerged to explain what factors modify the behaviour of the normally viscerotropic <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasite to become dermatotropic and manifest as PKDL. In the following sections, we review key mechanisms suggested to be involved in the development of PKDL.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>A role for antimonial drugs</title><p>Epidemiological data and clinical reports have strongly suggested a link between administration of sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) and subsequent development of PKDL <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In India, 62 out of 85 (73%) patients with PKDL who were followed up for 9 years after cure from VL were treated with SAG for VL <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A minority (23/85, 27%) developed PKDL after being treated for VL with amphotericin B (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13), ambisome (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), miltefosine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), miltefosine&#x02013;amphotericin B (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1), or paromomycin (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5), respectively. In Sudan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, 100% of PKDL patients received SAG <xref rid="bib0020 bib0025 bib0030 bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[4&#x02013;7]</xref>, suggesting that SAG could well influence the development of PKDL. A small subgroup of 15&#x02013;20% of patients with PKDL gave no prior history of VL, attributable to subclinical infection and had therefore not received any drug during that period <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is interesting, however, that SAG can and is still being used for the treatment of PKDL, although at a higher dose and for a prolonged period (20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day, intramuscular, for 4 months) than required for the treatment of VL (20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for 3 weeks). It is also plausible that differences in systemic versus skin concentrations of antileishmanial drugs permit the survival of parasites in the latter. However, before incriminating SAG for the development of PKDL, further data are required on the frequency of PKDL in cured VL patients treated with other more recently introduced antileishmanial drug regimens. Due to the rise in antimony resistance, there is now a long history of using miltefosine and amphotericin B to treat patients with VL in India <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As noted above, Thakur <italic>et al.</italic> reported that using amphotericin B (20&#x000a0;mg/kg) for the treatment of VL effectively minimised development of PKDL, whereas in individuals treated with lower doses of amphotericin B (15&#x000a0;mg/kg), PKDL was reported <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Patients who received miltefosine, paromomycin, and a combination therapy of amphotericin B/miltefosine have rarely been found to develop PKDL <xref rid="bib0085 bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[17&#x02013;19]</xref>. Collectively, available data strengthened the notion that SAG directly or indirectly influences the incidence of PKDL, but definitive evidence may require another decade, because in India, PKDL can develop 20&#x02013;40 years after cure from VL <xref rid="bib0010 bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[2,18]</xref>. Another speculation is that antileishmanial drugs used at lower doses and for a shorter duration eliminated parasites from the viscera, not from the skin, which required a higher dose. Hence, PKDL might not only be drug-related but could also result from a dose-related phenomenon (Hypothesis 1). A more formal understanding of drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics is clearly warranted.</p><p>In addition to epidemiological evidence, immunological data also support this hypothesis, because levels of immunoregulatory cytokines transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), factors that support parasite persistence, remained high even after completion of treatment with SAG <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, whereas this was not the case with amphotericin B or miltefosine <xref rid="bib0100 bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. Furthermore, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, treatment of THP1 macrophages with SAG caused elevation of two anti-inflammatory, disease-sustaining molecules, namely haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and glutathione <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Another contributory factor is the inability of SAG to restore the peroxisome function of the host <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Additionally, the failure of SAG to provide a sterile cure strongly indicates the possibility of drug-induced genetic alterations in resistant parasites; SAG-resistant parasites are proposed to have an enhanced degree of &#x02018;fitness&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another pertinent observation is that PKDL-causing strains expressed higher levels of promastigote surface antigen (PSA2) and glycoprotein 63 (gp63), molecules associated with dermatotropism; concomitantly, they had decreased expression of amastigote antigen 2 (A2), which is linked with enhanced viscerotropism <xref rid="bib0125 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. Given our recent understanding of the plasticity of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and improved capacity and cost reductions associated with parasite genome sequencing, future studies aimed at characterising PKDL isolates with various drug histories are now clearly essential and have become technically and financially achievable.</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>UV light contributes towards development of PKDL</title><p>Lesions of PKDL consistently appear on sun-exposed areas, particularly the face, ears, arms, etc., rather than unexposed areas, such as the scalp and chest. This supports the concept that exposure to UV light plays a contributory role in the pathogenesis of PKDL (Hypothesis 2) (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This role of UV light is further highlighted by the characteristic presence of photosensitivity in patients with PKDL. The potent immunosuppressive property of UV light is linked to its ability to damage the antigen presenting epidermal Langerhans cells (E-LCs) and inhibit contact hypersensitivity and alloantigen responses <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. UVB light (280&#x02013;320&#x000a0;nm)-induced immunosuppression can operate either through its chromophore <italic>cis</italic>-urocanic acid or via modulation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib0150 bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref>. During keratinisation, <italic>trans</italic>-urocanic acid produced from histidine undergoes <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> UV-induced photoisomerisation. All dermal cell types are affected, especially E-LCs, wherein their numbers are reduced and their morphology, particularly, the characteristic dendritic pattern is altered; together, this attenuates the antigen presenting property of dermal cells <xref rid="bib0160 bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>. These E-LCs from UV-irradiated skin have reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, along with a loss of co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86, which translates into impaired antigen presentation (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib0170 bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[34,35]</xref>. Additionally, by exerting its influence on keratinocytes and lymphocytes, <italic>cis</italic>-urocanic acid modulates a vast array of cytokines that range from proinflammatory tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive IL-10 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In view of the fact that 40% of the adult population are UVB sensitive, based on their impairment of hapten-induced contact-dependent hypersensitivity, this may also account for the low proportion of individuals developing PKDL after cure from VL <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Studies on lesional patterns often mirror the clothing habits of individuals, which strongly suggest a link between exposure to UV light and the pathogenicity of PKDL <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, no such study has been undertaken in India but, notably, there is a consistent sparing of photoprotected areas. Available data from Indian PKDL showed a downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, similar to that resulting from UV irradiation <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and an increased expression of cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 at the lesional site <xref rid="bib0185 bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[37,38]</xref>. These data endorse a causal role for UV light in both disease pathogenesis and immunosuppression.</p><p>UV, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and dihydroxylated vitamin D<sub>3</sub> [1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>] have a potent immunomodulatory role <xref rid="bib0155 bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[31,39]</xref> in which UV light enhances the synthesis of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). 7-Dehydrocholesterol absorbs UV light and is converted into vitamin D<sub>3</sub> by a series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The circulating vitamin D<sub>3</sub> binds to vitamin D-binding protein (VBP) and subsequently enters immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. Within the cells upon further hydroxylation by a mitochondrial enzyme CYP27B1, the active 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is formed, which then forms a complex with vitamin D receptor (VDR). The complex then translocates into the nucleus, and after binding to the vitamin D response elements (VDREs), induces synthesis of antibacterial peptides and immunomodulatory factors, such as cathelicidin (LL-37), TGF-&#x003b2;, and arginase <xref rid="bib0200 bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[40,41]</xref>. The influence of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on the immune system appears dichotomous. On the one hand, it induces synthesis of potentially host-protective antibacterial peptides from macrophages, whereas on the other, it inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced activation of macrophages, downregulates co-stimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, and also induces TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-1. This ability to upregulate the arginase pathway implies that 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or vitamin D<sub>3</sub> facilitates alternative activation of macrophages <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Additionally, the increased presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) promotes IL-10 secretion, thereby suppressing the local immune response and supporting parasite persistence. In Indian PKDL, an increased presence of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), a key molecular marker of Tregs, has been reported <xref rid="bib0045 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[9,43]</xref>. Indeed, in B6.<italic>Vdr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (which lack the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor), resistance to <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection is enhanced. Conversely, treatment of wild type mice with 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> led to a VDR-dependent inhibition of macrophage killing, induction of arginase, and downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A strong case between exposure to UV and PKDL in terms of dermal phenotypic changes exists, but does not necessarily constitute an argument for causation. Nevertheless, there is sufficient data to warrant further exploration of the role of UV light in the aetiopathogenesis of PKDL, potentially feasible in animal models. Alternatively, a metabolomic analysis to determine metabolites of the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> pathway could strengthen this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>PKDL: a disease of reinfection or parasite persistence?</title><p>A hallmark of many infectious diseases is persistence of the pathogen after clinical cure, which occurs in tuberculosis, viral infections (e.g., herpes), and protozoan diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis) <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In leishmaniasis, evidence of parasite persistence after clinical cure exists <xref rid="bib0230 bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[46,47]</xref>, and in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic, recurrence has been attributed to parasite persistence and/or reinfection (Hypothesis 3). The optimal approach would be to characterise these parasites and compare them with the parental type, preferably using genomic and/or proteomic analysis. This would establish whether the parasites were sourced from the visceral form of the disease or after reinfection. In a mouse model, parasites that persisted were genetically similar to the parental clone <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>; however, analogous studies in humans are logistically not possible, in view of the parasite density being insufficient for establishment of parasite isolates <xref rid="bib0225 bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[45,47]</xref>. Because strains isolated from individuals with VL and PKDL in India have genetic heterogeneity <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, the axis tends to tilt in favour of reinfection. On the contrary, it can be hypothesised that parasites reside within an alternative cell type, such as fibroblasts or keratinocytes, during the latency period and, when reactivated, cause PKDL <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To address this issue, parasites would need to be isolated from a patient suffering from VL and compared with those isolated from the very same individual when PKDL develops, which in practical terms is very difficult owing to the long and unpredictable lag period between VL and onset of PKDL. However, such studies are feasible in Sudan where the onset of PKDL following VL is much shorter <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In Sudan, PKDL is probably due to parasite persistence because patients cured of VL developed PKDL even after relocating to an area where VL is not endemic (A.M. El Hassan <italic>et al</italic>., personal communication). Another challenge to the reinfection theory is why should genetically different strains exclusively cause PKDL, and not re-emergence of VL? An important factor possibly preventing reinfection could be that VL generates a strong systemic memory response, but a concomitant failure of tissue-specific immunity allows parasites to multiply in the skin.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><title>Failure of tissue-specific T cell memory</title><p>Recovery from <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection is often associated with development of a strong memory immune response that in humans confers lifelong protection against reinfection (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression, this infection-induced immunity may be impaired, rendering the host susceptible to infection and/or reactivation of latent parasites <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The diverse tissue microenvironments where parasites are found in VL, such as the liver and spleen, qualitatively and quantitatively influence various aspects of host immunity <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this context, PKDL poses an interesting challenge because despite acquisition of systemic protective immunity, apparent from the recall cytokine or proliferative T cell responses measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or whole blood assays <xref rid="bib0045 bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[9,52]</xref>, organ-specific immune deficits do occur in the skin. This was evidenced by a local increase of Tregs expressing the transcription factor FoxP3 and a preponderance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="bib0045 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[9,53]</xref> (Hypothesis 4, <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>PKDL in Sudan and South Asia differ significantly in terms of their disease outcome: in Sudanese PKDL, the lesions regress spontaneously, whereas in South Asia, prolonged treatment is essential <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This difference might be correlated with the lag period of the disease, because in Sudan patients develop PKDL with a much shorter lag period or immediately after cure from VL and their immunological responses might mimic post-VL features, that is, active immune memory. In South Asia, there is a long lag period and immunological responses differ significantly and show immune anergy, that is, failure to elicit an antigen-specific immune response <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Immune memory is a property of central memory (CM) T cells (having a CD62L<sup>hi</sup>, CD45RB<sup>hi</sup>, and CCR7<sup>hi</sup> phenotype) and effector memory (EM) T cells (having a CD62L<sup>low</sup>, CD45RB<sup>hi&#x02013;low</sup>, and CCR7<sup>low</sup> phenotype) <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, the latter being more functionally relevant than the former <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, in Indian PKDL due to the paucity of T helper (Th) cells in the dermal lesions <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, the disease acquires a non-self-healing nature. However, in Sudan, an increased dermal presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is associated with self-healing PKDL. This concept would hold if comparative studies with the non-self-resolving Indian and self-healing Sudanese PKDL showed different memory responses. In Indian PKDL, antigen-specific recall responses as measured by response to <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was intact, whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were functionally impaired <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, establishing the functional ability of these CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells is necessary. Another important factor that might play an important role in the distinct pathology of Indian and Sudanese PKDL is the expression of CD25 (the IL-2 receptor), present on the regulatory T cell surface <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In Sudanese PKDL, dermal biopsies showed a decreased presence of CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, whereas in the Indian variant, cells bearing CD25 were significantly increased <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>For homing of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased expression of the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) is important for self-resolution as observed in localised self-resolving cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), whereas the lack of CLA expression in diffuse CL (DCL) correlates with a non-healing outcome <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. One can therefore envisage that in PKDL, aberrant expression of CLA prevents CD4<sup>+</sup> EM T cells from homing to the dermal lesions. Granuloma formation in the skin has been proposed to confer protection against leishmaniasis as evidenced in CL <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Importantly, in PKDL, granuloma formation is scanty and because Indian PKDL is accompanied with a substantial decrease in the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="bib0190 bib0260 bib0265 bib0285" ref-type="bibr">[38,52,53,57]</xref>, it strengthens the notion that impaired tissue-specific immunity underpins disease persistence.</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><title>Host genetic susceptibility factors</title><p>All the factors discussed above have focused on different aspects of host immunity, wound healing, and regeneration of the immune memory response, all of which can potentially be regulated by the host genotype. Various forms of leishmaniasis have been subjected to intense genetic analysis in murine models and humans, but data pertaining to patients with PKDL remain preliminary and are restricted to three studies <xref rid="bib0290 bib0295 bib0300 bib0305" ref-type="bibr">[58&#x02013;61]</xref>. However, because all three studies were performed in Sudan, the conundrum remains unresolved as to why some but not all patients with VL develop PKDL. A significant association between interferon &#x003b3; receptor (IFN-&#x003b3;R polymorphism) and development of PKDL has been reported (Hypothesis 5, <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="bib0310 bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[62,63]</xref>. This was important because several studies have reported an increased presence of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the lesions <xref rid="bib0045 bib0185 bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[9,37,52]</xref>. Polymorphisms in IFN-&#x003b3;R are associated with its decreased functionality and expression that resulted in decreased responsiveness, despite high levels of IFN-&#x003b3;. Although a critical balance between IFN-&#x003b3; versus IL-4 and/or IL-10 secreting cells is essential in leishmaniasis <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, no correlation was found between IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-10 promoter polymorphism and disease susceptibility <xref rid="bib0315 bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[63,65]</xref>. Furthermore, the failure to respond adequately to IFN-&#x003b3; during active disease due to IFN-&#x003b3;R1 being compromised would facilitate parasite growth and multiplication. Indeed, expression of IFN-&#x003b3;R1 is lower in individuals with Indian PKDL as compared with healthy controls <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In Sudan, PKDL tends to develop in patients with VL having higher levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), but the question remains as to whether genetic polymorphisms in CRP genes or their promoters correlate with individuals having a higher propensity to develop PKDL <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Genes involved in innate immunity, particularly those associated with complement activation, such as <italic>FCN</italic>-2 (encoding Ficolin-2), are associated with an enhanced susceptibility to CL <xref rid="bib0335 bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[67,68]</xref>. Polymorphisms at the promoter regions of the <italic>FCN</italic>-2 gene are associated with its decreased expression and increased susceptibility to CL <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. The increased expression of mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) was stated to be associated with VL and, indeed, increased serum levels of MBL2 and genetic polymorphism at the promoter and exons of <italic>MBL2</italic> correlated with disease susceptibility <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Another important candidate gene for leishmaniasis is <italic>SLC11A1</italic> (formerly known as <italic>NRAMP1</italic>), which encodes the solute carrier family 11a (SLC11A1). SLC11A1 functions as a proton/divalent cation antiporter present on the endosomal membrane of phagocytes. SLC11A1 has diverse effects on macrophage activation, including regulation of IL-1&#x003b2;, iNOS, MHC class II molecules, TNF-&#x003b1;, nitric oxide (NO) release, oxidative burst, and antimicrobial activity <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Polymorphisms of <italic>SLC11A1</italic> at the promoter and exons make it functionally null and are associated with increased susceptibility to VL (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="bib0355 bib0360" ref-type="bibr">[71,72]</xref>. The lack of studies with PKDL emphasises the need to establish susceptibility determinants. Additionally, it can be envisaged that investigation of epigenetic modification(s) in the aforementioned genes would help establish the underlying cause(s) for development of PKDL.</p></sec><sec id="sec0035"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>PKDL is a perplexing disease, in particular for the shift in parasite tropism after the onset of apparent cure from VL and for the geographical variation in clinical presentation. The factors discussed above provide suitable explanations for PKDL, at least in some geographical settings. The lack of mouse models of PKDL precludes formal testing of some of these hypotheses but they have helped focus attention on how best to analyse the available clinical material. Thus, it can be concluded that development of PKDL is multifactorial and one/more of the hypotheses discussed above have a contributory role on the development of the disease, and future research should aim to address the several unanswered yet relevant questions (<xref rid="tb0010" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 2</xref>). Studies of parasite genotypes and phenotypes are clearly a high priority and need to be intimately linked to state-of-the-art functional histopathology, including, for example, tissue-based transcriptomics. In years to come, creative clinical studies on this challenging disease merged with the application of the latest &#x02018;omics&#x02019; approaches are sure to yield new insights into the complexity of the <italic>Leishmania</italic>&#x02013;host interaction and open new doors for disease control.</p></sec><sec id="sec0040"><title>Disclaimer statement</title><p>The funders had no involvement in the preparation of this manuscript, the decision to submit or in the design of any of the studies from the authors&#x02019; laboratories.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antinori</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis as an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome</article-title><source>Br.

Such reactions in mice and humans are mediated by Th1 or T cytotoxic 1 (Tc1) effector cells and downregulated by Th2 or T regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The response develops in two distinct phases: (i) a sensitisation phase where the haptens penetrating the skin are captured by resident dendritic cells, which migrate to regional lymph nodes and induce activation of specific T cell precursors; (ii) the elicitation phase, which is induced by re-exposure to the same hapten at a remote skin site. Within a few hours, this leads to the rapid recruitment and activation of specific T cells and a local inflammatory response, which peaks at 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h after challenge.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Haem oxygenase 1</term><def><p>an essential enzyme in haem catabolism that cleaves haem to form biliverdin and carbon monoxide.

It induces the production of an array of cytokines and upregulates the expression of class I and class II MHC antigens, Fc receptor, and leukocyte adhesion molecules. It modulates macrophage effector functions, influences isotype switching, and potentiates the secretion of immunoglobulins by B cells. IFN-&#x003b3; also augments helper T cell expansion and may be required for helper T cell differentiation. IFN-&#x003b3;R is expressed at moderate levels on virtually every cell with the exception of erythrocytes. Upon binding to IFN-&#x003b3;, the receptor dimerises and activates transcription factors, resulting in increased production of proinflammatory molecules. Polymorphism in IFN-&#x003b3;R contributes to its lowered function and subsequently influences the cellular responsiveness towards IFN-&#x003b3;.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Interleukin 10 (IL-10)</term><def><p>an important immunoregulatory cytokine produced by many cell populations. Its main biological function seems to be the limitation and termination of inflammatory responses and the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of several immune cells such as T cells, B cells, NK cells, antigen-presenting cells, etc. Antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes are the primary targets of IL-10 by its ability to regulate the Th1/Th2 balance. IL-10 promotes the development of a Th2 immune pattern by inhibiting the IFN-&#x003b3; production of T lymphocytes, particularly via the suppression of IL-12 synthesis in macrophages. IL-10 is also secreted from T regulatory cells to counter balance inflammation.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Kala-azar</term><def><p>an alternative name for visceral leishmaniasis.

Miltefosine belongs to the class of alkylphosphocholine drugs, which are phosphocholine esters of aliphatic long-chain alcohols.

For the treatment of PKDL, the same dose has been used but the duration increased to 12 weeks. Miltefosine has a dual effect on leishmaniasis because it causes mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species resulting in an apoptotic-like death in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites; in parallel, it raises the proinflammatory cytokines and molecules in <italic>Leishmania</italic>-infected macrophages and in patients with human leishmaniasis.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Papulonodules</term><def><p>a papule is a circumscribed, solid elevation of skin with no visible fluid and indurations, whereas nodules are larger solid areas of skin, with more than 0.5&#x000a0;cm area and indurations.

PSA2 is an immunologically reactive protein that induces high levels of Th1 cytokines and is therefore considered as a vaccine candidate.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Self-limiting PKDL</term><def><p>in Sudan, spontaneous healing frequently occurs in patients with PKDL, and is considered as self-limiting PKDL.

After being converted into the trivalent form, it enters into macrophages/parasites and shows a dual effect. It causes an apoptosis-like death in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites by generation of reactive oxygen species, depletion of thiols, modulation of energy metabolism, and by inhibition of DNA topoisomerases. Additionally in macrophages, it induces a generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Initially, Sb(V) was used in a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg for 6&#x02013;10 days, but increasing unresponsiveness in India led to successive upward revisions, and currently the amount of drug being used is ten times more than in previous years. Due to irregularity of use and poor patient compliance, resistance against this drug has emerged. Increased presence of drug efflux pumps and raised levels of non-protein thiols are the major molecular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in parasites.

Therefore, information from one is not extrapolatable to the other <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In Sudanese PKDL, because of the shorter time lag between cure from VL and development of PKDL, the disease-associated immune involvement mimics the scenario of immune reactivation after cure from VL. PBMCs from Sudanese PKDL patients react and proliferate following induction by <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens and secrete more IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas IL-10 was produced primarily from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. By contrast, South Asian PKDL is more chronic due to the longer gap between cure from VL and disease onset. Here, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells predominated in lesions and circulation <xref rid="bib0265 bib0365" ref-type="bibr">[53,73]</xref>. Tregs also play an important role in the lesional immunology of South Asian PKDL, as evident by their elevated mRNA expression of FoxP3, CTLA-4, and CD25 <xref rid="bib0045 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[9,43]</xref>. In addition to lesional immunology, systemic immune changes include increased antigen-induced IL-10 within circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and impairment of antigen-induced proliferation. These cells were anergic in nature because they lost their surface co-stimulatory CD28 molecule <xref rid="bib0045 bib0365" ref-type="bibr">[9,73]</xref>. Furthermore, the interacting partner of CD28, known as B7.1 or CD86, on monocytes was decreased, suggesting that an immunosuppressive milieu occurs in circulation <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Lesional immunology of PKDL was similar in South Asian and Sudanese PKDL with enhanced expression of IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b1;. However, despite the higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, the expression of IFN-&#x003b3;R and TNFR1 was lower in patients with PKDL in India and increased after treatment <xref rid="bib0185 bib0370" ref-type="bibr">[37,74]</xref>. Similarly, in the Sudanese variant, a genetic polymorphism was found in IFN-&#x003b3;R <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In Sudanese PKDL, expression of IL-10 from keratinocytes was considered as a key factor and a predictor for development of PKDL, particularly after cure from VL <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, the decreased presence of E-LCs plays a contributory role for immune suppression.
