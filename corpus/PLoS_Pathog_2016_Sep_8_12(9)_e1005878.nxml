Following <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection, the establishment of latency involves the chromatinization of the incoming viral genomes and recruitment of the host Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) to the promoters of lytic genes, which is accompanied by the inhibition of lytic genes. However, the mechanism of how PRCs are recruited to the KSHV episome is still unknown. Utilizing a genetic screen of latent genes in the context of KSHV genome, we identified the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) to be responsible for the genome-wide recruitment of PRCs onto the lytic promoters following infection. We found that LANA initially bound to the KSHV genome right after infection and subsequently recruited PRCs onto the viral lytic promoters, thereby repressing lytic gene expression. Furthermore, both the DNA and chromatin binding activities of LANA were required for the binding of LANA to the KSHV promoters, which was necessary for the recruitment of PRC2 to the lytic promoters during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection. Consequently, the LANA-knockout KSHV could not recruit PRCs to its viral genome upon <italic>de novo</italic> infection, resulting in aberrant lytic gene expression and dysregulation of expression of host genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation pathways. In this report, we demonstrate that KSHV LANA recruits host PRCs onto the lytic promoters to suppress lytic gene expression following <italic>de novo</italic> infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Persistent KSHV infection of humans requires the establishment of viral latency in B cells and endothelial cells following primary infection. This involves the spatially and temporally ordered recruitment of host epigenetic factors onto the viral DNA during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, resulting in the genome-wide repression of lytic (but not latent) gene expression. We have previously shown that the host epigenetic repressor Polycomb Repressive Complexes bind to the KSHV genome and play a role in the inhibition of lytic gene expression following <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Using reverse genetics approaches, we identified the latent KSHV protein LANA to be responsible for the recruitment of the Polycomb proteins onto the promoters of lytic genes following <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Importantly, our study revealed a novel role for LANA in KSHV infection. LANA initiates the recruitment of host repressive epigenetic factors onto the incoming viral genome to suppress lytic gene expression, which is ultimately required for the establishment of KSHV latency in the hosts and the development of KSHV-associated cancers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id

A hallmark of the seven known human tumor viruses is their ability to cause persistent infection of humans. One of these oncoviruses is Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or Human Herpesvirus 8), the etiologic agent of the vascular tumor Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma (KS), and two B cell lymphomas: primary effusion lymphoma and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that KSHV pathogenesis depends on the latent infection of B cells and lymphatic endothelial cells, but the mechanism by which latency is established following primary infection is still largely unknown.</p><p>KSHV has a double-stranded DNA genome of ~165-kb encoding more than 80 genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The majority of viral genes encode lytic proteins required for viral DNA replication and virion production, and they are expressed in a temporally ordered manner during reactivation. In contrast, during latency the lytic gene expression is repressed and only the latent genes (the latency-associated nuclear antigen (<italic>LANA</italic> or <italic>ORF73</italic>), <italic>v-Cyclin</italic> (<italic>ORF72</italic>), <italic>v-FLIP</italic> (<italic>K13</italic> or <italic>ORF71</italic>), <italic>Kaposin</italic> (<italic>K12</italic>) and viral <italic>miRNAs</italic>) are constitutively expressed from the latency locus of the viral genome [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These latent viral products are involved not only in the maintenance of viral latency, but also in growth-transformation and cell cycle-deregulation, both of which can contribute to the development of KSHV-induced cancers [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, transgenic mice expressing KSHV latent genes in B cells develop B cell hyperplasia and lymphomas [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of the latent gene products, LANA has a particularly critical role in both viral pathogenesis and the maintenance of latent infection. LANA is a multifunctional viral protein that ensures the concurrent latent replication of viral DNA with the host genome and the segregation of replicated KSHV genomes into the daughter cells during mitosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, LANA can regulate both viral and cellular gene expression by interacting with numerous transcription and epigenetic factors as well as modulating many signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These LANA-associated functions have been implicated to play critical roles in the maintenance of latency by inhibiting lytic gene expression and viral pathogenesis by deregulating host signaling pathways.</p><p>Recent works have demonstrated that the establishment of KSHV latency involves a dynamic interaction of the viral genome with cellular epigenetic factors during <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While the KSHV genome is linear and histone-free in the virion, upon infection it becomes circular and is maintained as an episome that adopts a chromatin structure similar to the host chromosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We and others have demonstrated that different combinations of activating and repressive histone modifications on the viral episome are involved in the regulation of both the latent and lytic gene expression programs of KSHV [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that, following <italic>de novo</italic> infection, the KSHV genome rapidly becomes chromatinized and undergoes different chromatin states [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The viral genome initially acquires a transcriptionally permissive chromatin structure (euchromatin marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) that allows the expression of a subset of viral lytic genes. Thereafter, transcriptionally repressive chromatin (heterochromatin) forms on the KSHV genome resulting in the repression of lytic gene expression, a crucial step in the establishment of viral latency. Two of the major cellular transcription repressor complexes for the viral heterochromatin formation are the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PRC2 is composed of three core subunits (EZH2, SUZ12 and EED) that interact with other transcription repressors such as histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases to maintain gene silencing [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EZH2 functions as a histone methyltransferase within PRC2, catalyzing the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a hallmark of PRC2 function on chromatin. PRC1 is also a multisubunit complex containing the histone H2A mono-ubiquitin ligases RING1A/B, its regulatory subunit BMI-1 and other accessory factors. PRCs can repress gene expression in many different ways such as blocking the activity of RNA polymerase II and histone methyltransferases involved in transcription activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that both PRCs are involved in the downregulation of transient lytic gene expression following KSHV infection. We have shown that both PRCs can bind to the entire KSHV episome after 24 hours postinfection (hpi). As with the host genome, PRC1 recruitment depends on the PRC2-mediated pre-deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 on the viral chromatin [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While the recruitment of PRC2 onto its cellular target genes is often mediated by long non-coding RNAs and transcription factors, the mechanism by which PRC2 is initially recruited onto the KSHV genome following <italic>de novo</italic> infection is still unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we hypothesized that KSHV latent factors might be involved in the recruitment of the PRC2 complex onto the viral episomes during <italic>de novo</italic> infection.

Upon infection the viral DNA gets chromatinized in a way that results in the repression of lytic but not the latent genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our previous study showed that polycomb proteins, which maintain the repression of lytic gene expressions during latency, are recruited onto the KSHV genome after 24 hpi, but the mechanism of their recruitment remained unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this study, we identified the latent KSHV protein LANA to be responsible for the genome-wide recruitment of polycomb proteins onto the viral DNA, a crucial step for the repression of lytic genes following <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Furthermore, we found that despite the co-localization of LANA with both PRCs in the LANA speckles of KSHV-infected cells, LANA interacts only with PRC2 but not PRC1 proteins. This indicates that LANA may not directly recruit PRC1 onto the KSHV genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. In fact, we have previously shown that the binding of PRC1 to lytic promoters depends on the PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 pre-deposition on the viral chromatin [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, we propose the model wherein as soon as LANA is expressed during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, it binds to the viral episome and recruits PRC2 onto the lytic promoters after 24 hpi. Once H3K27me3 is deposited on the viral chromatin by PRC2, PRC1 is then recruited. Ultimately, this LANA-initiated sequential recruitment of host epigenetic repressors onto lytic promoters results in the inhibition of lytic genes, a critical part of the establishment and maintenance of viral latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005878.g007">Fig 7E</xref>).</p><p>Numerous transcription factors and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified to play a role in the recruitment of PRC2 to its target genes on the cellular genome, resulting in either gene-specific or chromosome-wide gene silencing [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For instance, X chromosome inactivation in female mammals is regulated by the Xist ncRNA-mediated spreading of PRC2 along the X chromosome [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, PRC2 is simultaneously recruited throughout the KSHV genome following <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that the KSHV genome undergoes a temporally-ordered biphasic euchromatin-to-heterochromatin transition following infection prior to the establishment of latency. Between 24&#x02013;72 hpi, as the level of activating histone marks declined on the KSHV genome, the level of the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark increased concomitantly with the decline of lytic gene expression. Importantly, this transition to heterochromatin was dependent on both PRC 1 and 2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this report, we identified the latent protein LANA to be responsible for recruiting the polycomb proteins onto the viral episome, which shows a widespread binding on the KSHV genome similar to EZH2 during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. LANA has been shown to possess both sequence specific and promiscuous DNA-binding activity, while it also interacts with histones and numerous transcription and chromatin regulatory factors, which can mediate its genome-wide binding to the KSHV episome [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is also known that LANA binds to and is highly enriched on the terminal repeats of KSHV. This contributes to the local LANA concentration in the vicinity of the viral episome in the nucleus, thereby facilitating LANA enrichment on the KSHV genome [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In accordance with our results, LANA has been reported to bind to multiple sites throughout the KSHV genome during latency [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Unlike previous studies that showed the restricted numbers of LANA-binding sites on KSHV genome during latency, our results indicate a broader LANA-binding along KSHV episome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, suggesting that the differences of LANA-binding are potentially due to the differences of viral lifecyle. Specifically, since the chromatinization of the KSHV genome is a dynamic multi-step process during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, KSHV epigenome and its 3D-chromatin conformation may be not fully developed yet right after infection compared to those during latency conditions, which may affect LANA-binding profiles in the different phases of infection. Furthermore, these differences may be also attributed to the differences of cell lines, ChIP conditions, and ChIPseq analyzing algorithms. Importantly, we included the LANA KO recombinant KSHV as a negative control and the 3xFLAG-LANA recombinant KSHV as a positive control for LANA ChIP assays to examine the widespread binding of LANA on the viral genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection.</p><p>Importantly, we found that a chromatin- and DNA-binding LANA mutant, which lacks the ability to bind to the viral episome could not recruit EZH2 or RING1B to the lytic promoters, indicating an essential role of LANA&#x02019;s viral genome binding activity in the polycomb recruitment. Since the chromatin-binding or DNA-binding LANA mutants are also defective in the LANA nuclear speckle formation and latent replication of the KSHV genome during mitosis, it is also possible that LANA nuclear speckle formation or LANA-controlled latent replication may also contribute to its PRC2 recruitment [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, our confocal microscopy analysis of infected cells revealed that LANA remained associated with the polycomb proteins through mitosis, indicating a potential role of LANA in transmitting PRCs-regulated heterochromatin to the newly synthesized viral episome during latent replication. Thus, additional studies are required to dissect how various LANA-associated functions can regulate the recruitment of PRC2 onto the viral genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection.</p><p>The highly structured KSHV epigenome characteristic of latency is derived from the sequential formation of distinct chromatin states of the KSHV genome following <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the factors regulating this process are largely unknown. We have previously shown that the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark is enriched on the viral DNA only after 24 hpi [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An elegant study by Gunther and colleagues revealed that the PML factor Sp100 is involved in the regulation of the H3K27me3 level on lytic promoters during <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The spatially and temporally ordered binding of polycomb proteins onto the KSHV genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection might be similarly regulated by a yet to be identified factor. Our data showed that LANA expression and its binding to viral promoters were substantially lower in the first 24 hpi compared to 72hpi, suggesting that the level of LANA-binding to the viral DNA may not be sufficient for the recruitment of PRC2 within the first 24 hpi. However, we found that both the additional ectopic expression of LANA and the resulting increased level of LANA-binding on the KSHV genome were not sufficient to recruit EZH2 within the first 24 hpi. These results indicate that, in addition to LANA, other factors may be required for the spatially and temporally ordered binding of polycomb proteins onto the KSHV genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Activating histone marks such as H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K36me3 and their associated transcription factors can inhibit the binding and activity of PRC2 at specific cellular genomic sites. On the other hand, removal of these histone marks by histone demethylases, deacetylases or chromatin remodeling can allow PRC2-binding [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. During the first 24 hours of infection, the KSHV genome acquires transcriptionally active chromatin enriched with the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Thus, we hypothesize that the euchromatin-like structure of KSHV may prevent PRC2-binding [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, the latency locus is devoid of EZH2 even though it has abundant LANA-occupancy and is constantly euchromatin-enriched with the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. We found that LANA-binding was not affected by the different chromatin states of the viral episome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, which is consistent with the previous studies showing that LANA binds to both H3K4me3-marked and heterochromatin-rich genomic sites [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Alternatively, the differential posttranslational modifications of LANA acquired during the different phases of <italic>de novo</italic> infection may be involved in the temporally ordered binding of EZH2. In addition, LANA has been shown to interact with a number of host epigenetic factors (e.g. KAP1, mSin3, DNMT3a, KDM3A, Tip60, and hSET1), which may also be involved in the timing of PRC2 recruitment to the viral episome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Additional studies are required to determine the regulation of the spatially and temporally ordered binding of polycomb proteins onto the KSHV genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection.</p><p>The role of LANA in transcription regulation has been mainly investigated in overexpression conditions and in the absence of KSHV infection. These studies have revealed that LANA regulates both latent and lytic viral gene expression as well as expression of host genes involved in cell cycle and survival signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To analyze the transcriptional role of LANA during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection, we determined how the expression of viral and host genes was affected in LANA KO KSHV-infected cells. We found that the lack of LANA resulted in a global upregulation of lytic gene expression in infected cells, which is consistent with the role of LANA in the PRC2-mediated genome-wide gene silencing during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Importantly, our data also show that the inhibition of lytic gene expression program by LANA was primarily mediated by the repression of RTA expression. LANA has been indicated to bind to and inhibit the RTA promoter during latency, thereby blocking lytic reactivation and maintaining latency [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition to the viral genome, LANA has also been shown to bind to a large number of transcriptionally active (H3K4me3-marked) promoters and enhancers of the host genome [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Strikingly, while LANA binds to a number of host promoters in latently infected cells, this binding does not considerably alter expression of these host genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In agreement with this, we also found weak but global changes of host gene expression in the p53 tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulation pathways in LANA KO KSHV-infected cells compared to those in WT KSHV-infected cells. However, this altered expression of host genes was reversed in LANA/RTA dKO KSHV-infected cells to the levels in WT KSHV-infected cells. Collectively, these data indicate that LANA globally inhibits viral lytic gene expression by repressing RTA expression during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Otherwise, increased viral lytic gene expression affects the expression of p53 tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulation pathways, which may compromise the establishment of latency.</p><p>Accumulating evidence shows that the establishment of latency and long-term persistence of KSHV in B cells and lymphatic endothelial cells is necessary for the development of KSHV-associated cancers. In this study, we identified the KSHV protein that initiates the sequential recruitment of host epigenetic factors onto the KSHV genome during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, which ultimately leads to the genome-wide silencing of lytic genes for the establishment of latency. We envision that many other viral and host factors can also play critical roles in the chromatinization of the KSHV genome prior to the establishment of latency and thus, the identification of these factors should lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of KSHV persistent infection and its associated pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Cells and antibodies</title><p>SLK (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and 293T (ATCC) cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).

The raw data was pre-processed by blank subtraction (one-step Tukey biweight subtraction) and intra-array (dye-bias) median normalization in order to equalize the ChIP (Cy5) and input (Cy3) DNA channels. Binding events, or enrichments were represented as increases in the ratios of the ChIP to input DNA signal intensities.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>NanoString analysis</title><p>This utilizes the simultaneous hybridization of two probes to the target mRNA for detection. One of the probes is the capture probe that can immobilize the target mRNA on a solid surface, while the reporter probes are color-coded allowing the identification of different mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005878.s007">S3A Fig</xref>). We purified total RNAs from WT, LANA KO, and LANA/RTA KO KSHV-infected cells at 72 hpi, and the viral mRNA levels were quantified by our customized panel of KSHV specific NanoString probes at the USC Epigenome Center. The differential viral gene expression of LANA KO virus-infected cells was calculated relative to WT KSHV-infected cells. For normalization the mRNA level of four housekeeping genes and the GFP of BAC16 was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Human gene expression microarray</title><p>Total RNA for the microarrays was purified from two biological replicates of uninfected and KSHV-infected SLK cells using Tri reagent (Sigma) and RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the protocols of the manufacturers. The human gene expression profiling was performed with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array at the UCLA Clinical Microarray Core. The raw expression data are available from the GEO database (accession number GSE78282). All microarray data analyses were performed by Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 unless otherwise indicated. The raw expression values were first normalized together with Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA). The RMA normalized data file containing all probes and their expression values with their gene IDs can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005878.s003">S3 Table</xref>. After performing microarray quality control, differential gene expression analysis was performed. For this, we employed hierarchical clustering using the average of the probe intensities of the duplicate biological experimental array datasets, which passed the threshold of 1.5 fold difference between uninfected and infected samples. The list of differentially expressed genes is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005878.s003">S3 Table</xref>. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between the wild type and LANA KO virus-infected samples was performed following guidelines as detailed on the GSEA website [<xref rid="ppat.1005878.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Using 1000 permutations of the GSEA hallmark gene sets and a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 was accepted as highly significant, which was highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005878.g003">Fig 3C</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005878.s004">S4 Table</xref> contains the full statistical GSEA analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>The uninfected and infected cells were grown on glass coverslips. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes and stored in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) at 4&#x000b0;C. Prior to the immunofluorescent staining, the samples were incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.2% Fish Skin gelatin in PBS) for 30 minutes. The antibodies were diluted in PBST. The primary antibodies that were used are anti-LANA (1/3000 dilution), anti-FLAG (1/100 for <italic>de novo</italic> infected cells and 1/1000 dilution for latently infected cells), anti-EZH2, anti-SUZ12, anti-BMI, anti-RING1B, anti-CYCT1, and anti-SPT5 (1/100 dilution). Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat 633, goat anti-rabbit 568, and donkey anti-mouse 647) were used in 1/500 dilution. Primary antibody staining was performed for 2 hours followed by three times 5 minutes wash with PBST. This was followed by 45 minutes of incubation with secondary antibodies then three times 5 minutes wash with PBST. Thereafter, ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied and the coverslips were layered onto microscope slides. The samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy using 60x objective and the images were processed, analyzed, merged, and quantified with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Gel filtration chromatography</title><p>Nuclear extracts derived from 10<sup>8</sup> of iSLK and iSLKBAC16 cells were fractionated on a GE Superose 6 GL column using a BioLogic DuoFlow Medium-Pressure Chromatography system (Bio-Rad).
