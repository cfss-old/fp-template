The interchange of functionally relevant organisms like insects occurs through these edges and can influence ecosystem functioning in both crop and non-crop habitats. However, very few studies have focused on the directionality of insect movement through edges, and the role of crop and non-crop amount has been ignored. Using bi-directional flight interception traps we investigated interchange of herbivore, natural enemy, pollinator and detritivore insects between native forest fragments and soybean crops, simultaneously considering movement direction, forest cover in the landscape and crop phenology. In total, 52,173 specimens and 877 morphospecies were collected. We found that, within most functional and taxonomic groups, movement intensity was similar (richness and/or abundance) between directions, whereas a predominantly forest-to-crop movement characterized natural enemies. Insect movement was extensively affected by crop phenology, decreasing during crop senescence, and was enhanced by forest cover particularly at senescence. Mainly the same herbivore species moved to and from the forest, but different natural enemy species predominated in each direction. Finally, our analyses revealed greater forest contribution to natural enemy than to herbivore communities in the crop, fading with distance to the forest in both groups. By showing that larger amounts of forest lead to richer insect interchange, in both directions and in four functional groups, our study suggests that allocation to natural and cultivated habitats at landscape level could influence functioning of both systems. Moreover, natural enemies seemed to benefit more than pests from natural vegetation, with natural enemy spillover from forests likely contributing to pest control in soybean fields. Thus consequences of insect interchange seem to be mostly positive for the agroecosystem, although consequences for the natural system deserve further study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas y T&#x000e9;cnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIP 112 201201 00662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valladares</surname><given-names>Graciela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007031</institution-id><institution>Secretar&#x000ed;a de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a, Gobierno de la Provincia de C&#x000f3;rdoba</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salvo</surname><given-names>Adriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y T&#x000e9;cnica&#x02014;Argentina (Grant number: PIP 112 201201 00662).

As a result, edges are becoming increasingly common habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The interchange of organisms between adjacent habitats occurs through these edges and is influenced by their contrast (i.e. how different the adjacent habitats are) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], shape [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], crop phenology [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and other characteristics of the landscapes and species involved (such as habitat patchiness or matrix quality) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Insects are an important taxonomic group for agriculture, including herbivore species and among them some of the most harmful crop pests, while on the other hand, contributing a wide variety of natural enemies that help controlling pest populations [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pest control provided by natural enemy insects, including parasitoids and predators, is an essential ecosystem service valued in $400 billion per year worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to herbivores and natural enemies, insects provide indispensable pollinators for more than two-thirds of the world&#x000b4;s cultivated species [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The value of the pollination ecosystem service has been estimated to be between $5000 and 14000 million per year in the US alone [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], from which a large proportion is attributed to native insect pollinators [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, detritivore insect species are relevant for crops because of their contribution to nutrient cycling [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; services provided by dung beetles alone may amount to $380 million per year [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Many species within these functional groups depend on the presence of natural ecosystems to complete their cycles [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, the proximity and amount of natural vegetation in the landscape can influence insect richness and abundance in agroecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is well known that insect biodiversity in crops is enhanced by the presence of non-crop habitats in the landscape [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but whether this is the result of improved interchange between habitats remains unknown.</p><p>Insect movement between crop and non-crop habitats can affect ecosystem functioning at both sides of the boundary (functional spillover) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For the productive land, these changes can have either positive (e.g. natural enemies contributing to reduce pest populations) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or negative (when herbivores arrive to crops and produce economic damage) consequences [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar outcomes might occur in natural habitats, however this topic has been much less studied [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to know which functional groups of insects are involved in crop / non-crop interchange and how this process is influenced by landscape structure or temporal changes.</p><p>The predominant direction of movement between natural and cultivated habitats is expected to follow resource availability and thus to change with the phenological status of the crop, with more herbivores and natural enemies moving to the crop after sowing and from the crop to the natural habitat after harvest [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The scarce evidence available supports the expectation of early non-crop to crop movement for herbivores [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, emigration of natural enemies from the crop seems to be continuous throughout its cycle, rather than a post-harvest peak [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For pollinators, movement in both directions is expected to be most intense during crop flowering. Moreover, since most species need natural habitats to complete their cycles, pollinators should move between both habitats within short periods of time [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As for detritivores, their interchange between natural and cultivated habitats has received little attention, but being mostly ground-dwelling organisms and considering the disturbances typical of agricultural soils, natural vegetation patches could act as refuges for these insects. Movement of dung and carrion beetles between natural and managed habitats seems to depend on edge permeability, with an intense interchange when both habitats have a similar structure [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a restricted movement for contrasting, hard edges [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we investigated the movement of herbivore, natural enemy, pollinator and detritivore insects at a forest-crop interface, simultaneously considering for the first time the effects of forest amount in the landscape and crop phenology, while also assessing forest contribution to insect communities in nearby cultivated fields. We emphasize the focus on herbivores and natural enemies, due to their relevance in agroecosystems as possible pests and biological control agents, respectively. By placing bi-directional flight interception traps at the boundary between soybean fields and remnants of Chaco Serrano forest, in nine circular landscapes with a gradient of forest cover and at three soybean phenological stages (vegetative, reproductive and senescent), we aimed to answer three questions: (1) Is the magnitude (number of species and individuals) and direction of insect movement at the forest-crop boundary influenced by soybean phenological stage and forest cover in the landscape? We addressed this question for each of the above mentioned functional groups and also for their major orders, so as to assess possible effects of differential flying behavior on trap captures [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; (2) Do herbivore and natural enemy communities moving from forest to soybean differ from those moving in the opposite direction, and how is their composition influenced by crop phenology and forest cover?; (3) Does movement from the forest to the crop represent a &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that influences the composition of insect communities within soybean fields?</p><p>We expected (1) movement intensity and direction to change along the crop cycle, with more insects moving from forest to crop during vegetative and flowering phases, while switching to a predominant crop-to-forest movement during crop senescence. However, this general trend could vary among functional groups. For herbivores, an early response to crop resources (high movement during vegetative stage) was expected. Natural enemies would show a delayed response [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], increasing their forest to crop movement during flowering, following their resource populations and taking advantage of additional resources like nectar and pollen in the crop. On the other hand, movement of pollinators would increase in both directions at the time of crop flowering, which would promote interchange between nesting and foraging habitats. Moreover, since landscapes with larger amounts of natural habitats usually sustain higher richness and/or abundance of insects, we expected movement intensity to be positively related with forest cover. Independently of changes in total number of species or individuals, particular species may show a directional movement either towards the crop or towards the forest [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], therefore we expected (2) low similarity in the communities moving in each direction, particularly at the beginning and end of the season when movement should be more directional. Finally, if insect movement from the forest to the crop indicates forest contribution to the makeup of soybean insect communities, we expected (3) similarity between assemblages moving towards soybean and those found within soybean fields to increase with forest proximity (because of insect flight limitations) and with forest cover (because of enhanced insect interchange).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area and sampling design</title><p>Sampling was performed from December 2010 to March 2011 at C&#x000f3;rdoba province, in central Argentina (31.10&#x000b0;&#x02013;31.30&#x000b0;S and 64&#x000b0;&#x02013;64.30&#x000b0;W).

Only forest edges facing west were selected, in order to standardize potential wind effects. Traps had a surface capture of 0.6 m<sup>2</sup> (100 x 60 cm) provided by a transparent PVC sheet stretched between two standing iron rods and placed 50 cm above the ground. Insects were collected in a plastic trough (11 cm diameter) below each side of the sheet, half-filled with 20% ethylene glycol. Bi-directional traps allow the study of insect movement direction, since insects flying perpendicular to the trap will hit the capture surface and fall into the trough.

These traps (diameter 34 cm, depth 9 cm) were placed at ground level, filled with 3 liters of water to which a few drops of detergent were added, and were active for 3 days during the vegetative period (20&#x02013;22/12/2010) almost at the same time as flight interception traps (for more details see [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). After a general sorting at family level, herbivores and natural enemies in the pan trap catches were classified to morphospecies level, for comparisons with flight interception traps data.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To analyze spatial (forest cover) and temporal (crop phenology) variations in the magnitude (= intensity) and direction of insect movement, we calculated abundance and species richness of the four functional groups captured with the flight interception traps and used them as response variables in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). Additional models were performed on abundance and richness of the dominant orders (those representing at least 5% of total abundance and richness) in each functional group. Poisson error distribution and log link function were used for richness, while a negative binomial error distribution was used to deal with overdispersion in abundance data. Forest cover proportion at each site (as a continuous variable), movement direction (as a factor with two levels: forest to crop, crop to forest) and crop phenology (as a factor with three levels corresponding to soybean phases: vegetative, reproductive, senescent) were the explanatory variables, and we included each pair of interactions between these variables (see expectations in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref> section). The triple interaction was not included since we had no biological hypothesis associated to it. We also included site as a random factor to model data dependence within each landscape circle and because of the repeated measures nature of the study design. Analyses were performed using the software R (version 2.15.1) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the package lme4 [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Model comparisons were made with AICc values (Akkaike information criterion with correction for finite sample size) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] using the package MuMIn [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and autocorrelation was checked using variograms of the residuals [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We compared the AICc values of all possible models, from the full model with all interactions to the null model, and selected the model with the lowest value of AICc as the top model. When differences in AICc were &#x02264;2, we further compared the models by likelihood ratio tests [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In order to investigate to which extent species moving from the forest to the crop were also found moving in the opposite direction in our flight interception traps captures, we analyzed similarity between assemblages collected at each side within each trap. Similarity was calculated for every site and soybean phase using Chao Jaccard abundance-based estimator [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Bias related to sample size is reduced in this index by estimating the probability that individuals belong to shared species and accounting for the effect of unseen shared species [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Chao Jaccard estimator was calculated using EstimateS (version 9.1.0) [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Then, using this index as response variable, we performed a GLMM with forest cover, crop phenology and their interaction as independent variables, with a normal error distribution and using the nlme package [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Finally, forest contribution via spillover to within-crop herbivore and natural enemy communities was assessed by analyzing the similitude between flight interception and pan trap samples. Thus we calculated, for each site, the Chao Jaccard Index between flight interception traps samples with forest to crop direction and yellow pan trap samples at each of the four distances to the forest (5, 25, 50 and 100m). Then, we ran GLMMs with Chao Jaccard Index as response variable against forest cover, distance to the forest and cover x distance interaction as independent variables. Site was also included as random factor and model selection was carried out using AICc values as explained above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Magnitude of the movement between forest and soybean</title><p>Our flight interception traps captured 52,173 arthropods belonging to 877 species.

In this paper, we offer the first simultaneous analysis of the effects of forest amount in the landscape and crop phenology on insect movement at a forest-crop interface, while also assessing forest contribution to insect communities in nearby cultivated fields. We found that while movement patterns varied among functional and taxonomic groups, a predominantly forest-to-crop movement was remarkably restricted to natural enemies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g001">Fig 1</xref>); we also found the intensity of insect movement to be extensively affected by crop phenology and mostly enhanced by forest cover in the landscape (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158836.t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we showed that mainly the same herbivore species moved to and from the forest, whereas natural enemy species displayed a more directional movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Finally, our analyses revealed forest contribution to insect communities in the crop to be greater for natural enemies than for herbivores, fading with distance to the forest in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Magnitude and direction of insect movement vs crop phenology</title><p>Annual crops like soybean are periodically subjected to mechanical [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and chemical [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] disturbances so they must be regularly colonized by insects from adjacent crops or natural habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Immigration to crops is expected to occur mainly after sowing, reversing at the time of crop senescence or harvest, when insects seek refuges in non-crop habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With more than 5,000 individuals in over 250 species flying within one week across an imaginary 0.6 m<sup>2</sup> window, our interception trap captures revealed an intense insect interchange between forest and soybean fields, mostly with similar numbers of species and/or individuals moving in either direction and generally declining as the crop entered senescence (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g002">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158836.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus our overall results suggest daily or periodic displacements, with insects moving to and from and using both habitats within hours or days, a trend more akin to a continuous process throughout the crop cycle [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] than to our expectation of forests acting alternatively as source and sink of insects depending on crop phenology. The fading intensity of insect interchange during crop senescence could be linked to the sharpened edge contrast at that stage, since such hard edges are usually characterized by low permeability and limited interchange [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, Collinge &#x00026; Palmer [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] found that ground-dwelling beetles were less likely to move across habitats when patches were embedded within a high contrast matrix, as would be in the case of senescent soybean when marked changes in plant pigmentation, resource quality and availability and sunlight exposition would increase contrast with the forest.</p><p>Studies on cross-edge spillover of insects between anthropogenic and natural habitats usually consider a directional movement i.e. insects dispersing actively in a given direction [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], however the interchange between crop and non-crop habitats can also be the result of routine or trivial movements [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] which seems a plausible explanation for our results. Insect interchange, even through trivial displacements, may have important consequences for ecosystem processes in the forest and in the crop [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], especially because organisms found at the interface are the most likely to cross habitat boundaries [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In pollinators, for example, the lack of differences between captures at either side of our bidirectional traps, could reflect periodic flights between forest and crop or daily activity patterns [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in order to use crop resources while satisfying their need for natural vegetation to complete their cycles [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In an important exception to the general trend described above, natural enemies showed various instances of directional movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Overall, more natural enemies (particularly in Coleoptera and Hymenoptera) moved from the forest toward the crop than viceversa. Given that natural enemies were the most diverse group moving in the forest-soybean interface, and considering previous observations of increased natural enemy richness in the forest proximity [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], these results suggest an interesting role for Chaco Serrano remnants as sources of natural enemies for soybean pests. Conversely, at the end of the crop cycle the forest may become a refuge from the barren matrix, as suggested by Hymenopteran natural enemies returning to the remnants of Chaco Serrano during soybean senescence.</p><p>Only two other instances of differential movement directions interacting with crop phenology were observed. One of them was provided by detritivores moving predominantly toward the forest at senescence, after moving indistinctly in both directions during earlier crop phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This was unexpected since no-tillage farming was used in the study sites, a system favoring the development of insect populations and resources for detritivores [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], however the need of additional resources or refuges provided by the forest appeared to be still relevant for this group. The other case was represented by Lepidoptera within herbivores, with more species moving from forest to soybean than in the opposite direction at the vegetative phase, and reverting to the forest during flowering and senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These changes could be explained by variations in resource availability, since various defoliating Lepidoptera are well known pests in early stages of soybean phenology [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], when adults could be expected to fly from the forest to lay their eggs on the crop. Although soybean still offers resources for defoliating larvae at flowering [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], changes in plant quality or intra and interspecific competition due to high herbivore density, could promote relatively early movement away from the crop, since these conditions can lead to dispersal [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and emigration [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Forest cover and insect interchange</title><p>The amount of non-crop habitats in the landscape is known to enhance insect diversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services in crops [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], most likely via increased inter-habitat movement of organisms when larger natural habitats are present, as suggested by a simulation study [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, the relationship between insect interchange and amount of non-crop habitats has been generally ignored. This first exploration of the issue revealed a predominantly positive link between the amount of forest cover in the landscape and the intensity of insect movement at the forest-crop interface, for the functional groups here analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158836.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, as forest cover in the landscape decreased, fewer species of natural enemies, detritivores and pollinators were found moving between forest and crop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s008">S8</xref> Figs). The enhancement of insect interchange in landscapes with higher proportion of forest cover becomes particularly relevant in the light of previous findings from the same region, which showed ecological processes such as parasitism [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and litter decomposition [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] in Chaco Serrano to improve with increasing forest size. At least for parasitism, such improvement was strongly linked to increased insect diversity [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Consequently, a richer forest-crop interchange may be expected to boost ecosystem services such as biological control, nutrient recycling or pollination in landscapes with relatively large forest cover.</p><p>The relationship between the number of insect species involved in crop / non-crop interchange and the amount of forest in the landscape was observed mostly during crop senescence when insect movement was generally lower. Insect interchange dropped noticeably during senescence in sites with lower forest cover but kept relatively homogeneous levels along the season in forest-dominated landscapes. Small remnants of natural vegetation, which are predominant in simplified landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] like our crop-dominated sites, tend to provide only temporal or semi-permanent habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and consequently, their role as sources of insects for crop / non-crop interchange would be limited in time. Therefore, by favoring temporal stability of insect movement, the larger forest cover found in our complex landscapes could lead to higher resilience in ecosystem services [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] involving natural enemies, pollinators or detritivores.</p><p>Increased forest cover also resulted in intensified herbivore exchange, along the flowering and senescence stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Given that forest-dominated landscapes offer fewer resources for crop herbivores [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], competition and resource limitation could turn the relatively scarce cultivated area into a low quality habitat, which would be assesed by the insects, increasing the probability of movement in search of a better habitat [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Contrary to the general positive pattern described above, a few insect groups responded negatively to forest cover. Fewer Lepidoptera moved across the edge at higher forest cover during the vegetative phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Since various species of Lepidoptera are important soybean pests, their diminished interchange in landscapes with a high proportion of natural habitats may mean a reduced provision of ecosystem dis-services [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] from the forest to soybean fields. On the other hand, the intense movement in simplified landscapes could have negative consequences for native vegetation, such as damage to leaves and fruits [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] or reduction in seed set [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], given that small fragments tend to be particularly vulnerable to herbivore spillover from crops [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A negative influence of forest cover on insect interchange was also observed for predatory and detritivorous species in Coleoptera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s004">S4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158836.s008">S8B</xref> Figs). Increased predator movement in crop-dominated landscapes where this group tends to be impoverished [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] could have positive consequences for soybean, but the above mentioned negative spillover effects on non-pest herbivores in the forest are likely to be still more important [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Composition of communities moving in each direction and spillover influence on soybean insects</title><p>Within herbivore communities, the species moving from the forest to the crop were frequently also found moving in the opposite direction, according to the high levels of similarity between captures at each side of each interception trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0158836.t002">Table 2</xref>). In other words, not only the numbers of herbivore species and individuals moving to and from the forest were similar, but they were mostly the same species, supporting the idea of boundary crossing mainly as the result of trivial movements rather than directional flights toward either crops or forests [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, natural enemy species appeared to be more distinctly associated to a particular movement direction than their prey or hosts, with remarkably lower similarity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Thus, even when the number of species moving in each direction was similar, the species themselves were different, i.e. some species moved more frequently toward the forest while others followed the opposite trend. Such directionality could result in a net positive contribution of the forest to the agricultural system, given that natural enemies flying toward soybean were at all times more abundant than those flying toward the forest, as reported above. Our results are in line with previous evidence suggesting that natural enemies are more likely to move between habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and to benefit from landscape complexity and the resources present in natural vegetation [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in comparison with herbivores. Moreover, in forest-dominated landscapes we found a growing representation of natural enemy species moving indistinctly in both directions, as expected if forests offer more alternative resources in this type of landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that are used periodically by predators and parasitoids. Furthermore, similarity between communities moving in one or other direction decreased along the soybean cycle, suggesting that scarce matrix resources during crop senescence may promote movement directionality.</p><p>In coincidence with their greater directionality, similarity between natural enemies moving from the forest to the crop and those captured on soybean duplicated the values observed in herbivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158836.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In other words, the predominant forest to crop movement of natural enemies seems to determine a greater contribution to the structure of soybean communities in comparison with herbivores. Supporting this result, there is evidence of in-crop density of natural enemies showing a stronger response than herbivores to nearby forest presence in the landscape [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Moreover, such forest contribution to crop communities decreased at larger distances in both groups, as observed in other studies addressing changes in diversity or abundance with proximity to non-crop habitats [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Nevertheless, the fact that at 100 meters from the forest the influence of forest spillover was almost null for herbivores, while still representing a substantial input for natural enemies in soybean, suggests a positive contribution from natural habitats to agroecosystems that must be highlighted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Summing up, our study has shown that larger amounts of forest in the landscape enhance insect interchange in four functional groups, mostly by engaging a wider diversity of species. Given that in most groups and most of the time, forest-to-crop and crop-to-forest insect movement were similarly intense, the relative allocation to each land use at landscape level could thus have consequences for the functioning of both ecosystems. In addition, we found that larger remnants of natural vegetation could promote temporal stability in ecosystem services by attenuating the generalized decline of insect interchange during crop senescence. Thus, crops in landscapes with high forest cover would receive a continuous influx of insects and therefore present higher levels of pest control or pollination.</p><p>Natural enemies (especially Coleptera and Hymenoptera) deviated from the general non-directional trend by moving most frequently from the forest to the crop, probably due to particular species migrating to and remaining in the crop for longer periods than non-directional species. Such natural enemy spillover was also boosted by increased forest cover and showed a remarkably stronger influence on the composition of soybean communities in comparison with that of herbivores. Altogether, these results support the contention of natural enemies benefiting more than pests from natural vegetation [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and suggest a likely contribution to pest control in the cultivated fields.</p><p>Insect interchange between crop and non-crop habitats could involve both positive and negative consequences for agricultural production [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study suggests a balance tilted to the positive side, in terms of natural vegetation boosting diversity of insects engaged in such interchange. This could lead to improved pollination and nutrient recycling in both systems and, particularly, enhanced natural pest control in agroecosystems. Such results seem to advocate for a shared land use framework [<xref rid="pone.0158836.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], that is, maintaining non-crop areas in agricultural landscapes in order to allow the coexistence of conservation and agricultural production. Nonetheless, consequences for the natural system deserve further study, especially considering the acceleration of insect movement towards the forest observed in particular taxa at specific times in crop phenology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158836.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Movement intensity of herbivores between forest and soybean crops.</title><p>Richness (a) and abundance (b) of total herbivores and the three main orders (Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera) moving toward crops (in green) and towards forest (in blue) at phenological phases of soybean (vegetative, reproductive, senescence).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158836.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158836.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Relationships between forest cover and herbivore movement.</title><p>Significant relationships between proportion of forest cover in the landscape and movement of herbivore insects at phenological phases of soybean: vegetative (green), reproductive (red) and senescence (blue).
