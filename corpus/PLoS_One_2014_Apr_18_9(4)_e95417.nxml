Furthermore, the methodology enables measurement of phenotypic plasticity by the detection of inter-annual variations within the populations. The spectral differences related to environment and taxonomy are interpreted biochemically, specifically variations of pollen lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and sporopollenins. The study shows large variations of absolute content of nutrients for congenital species pollinating in the same environmental conditions. Moreover, clear correlation between carbohydrate-to-protein ratio and pollination strategy has been detected. Infrared spectral database with respect to biochemical variation among the range of species, climate and biogeography will significantly improve comprehension of plant-environment interactions, including impact of global climate change on plant communities.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was supported by the Ministry of Education, Sciences and Sports of the Republic of Croatia ((grant 098-0982904-2927, the Unity Through Knowledge Fund (grant 92/11), the Norwegian Food Research Foundation and the Research Council of Norway (grants 199581/I10 and 173321/I10).

Spatial and temporal shifting, such as earlier onset of flowering and repositioning towards the poles, demonstrate widespread disruption in phenology of plants <xref rid="pone.0095417-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095417-Reyer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the projections of future changes are limited by incomplete theoretical understanding and insufficient data to improve ecological models <xref rid="pone.0095417-Reyer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To determine climate-related plant adaptation it is imperative to improve plant phenotyping and monitoring of plant communities by a cost-efficient and rapid methodology. Moreover, knowledge on plant traits could lead to artificial selection and genetic manipulation of economically important plants in order to develop cultivars adapted to extreme environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0095417-Savolainena1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Koti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Seed plants (spermatophytes) comprise almost 90% of all plant species. As all land plants, they alternate between sporophyte generation that makes up what we perceive as the plant, and a gamethophyte, a microscopic reproductive organism. Traditional plant phenotyping is focused on sporophytes, and obtaining objective and reproducible results is still a challenge to researchers. The main sources of variations are genetic differences within and among populations, effects of the environment on traits (phenotypic plasticity), and traits change over the course of growth (ontogenetic drift) <xref rid="pone.0095417-Kattge1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095417-Valladares1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, phenotyping of male gametophytes (i.e. pollen grains) is largely unexplored, given that characterization is predominantly based on morphological features while biochemical properties are regularly omitted.</p><p>Pollen studies can provide insight into plant-climate interactions <xref rid="pone.0095417-Benton1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Blackmore1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but unfortunately the research has remained basically unchanged in the last hundred years. Current pollen studies are still confined on time-consuming visual measurement of pollen under microscope by a qualified specialist <xref rid="pone.0095417-Hesse1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Biochemical characterization of pollen is important for one other reason: Impact of environment on plant fitness is almost exclusively based on studies of female functions, while the contribution of male gametophytes is mostly ignored. The latest finding, based on meta-analysis of 96 studies, suggests that measuring female function alone may misrepresent the effect of environmental factors on plant reproduction <xref rid="pone.0095417-Schaeffer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. During the last three decades there have been numerous studies on so-called pollen competition hypothesis and the relationship between pollen and offspring performance <xref rid="pone.0095417-Hedhly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Mulcahy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Godoy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The confirmation of the extensive overlap of the pollen transcriptome with that of sporophytes has provided further momentum that pollen selection can influence sporophytic fitness <xref rid="pone.0095417-Honys1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Initial spectroscopic studies clearly demonstrated that infrared (IR) spectra of pollen can be used for simple and rapid pollen analysis through straightforward correlation between spectra and biochemical composition <xref rid="pone.0095417-Gottardini1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Our previous study on 43 conifer species <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> revealed quite significant biochemical differences between closely related pollen species, which is rather unexpected since pollen morphologies of congeneric and confamiliar species seldom display substantial dissimilarities. In fact, due to negligible morphological differences between related species, pollen grains are rarely identified to the species level by microscopy, and some may have to be placed in groups of multiple genera or families. What is more, owing to natural hybridization and introgression, identification of the exact plant species is problematic even by means of genetic analysis <xref rid="pone.0095417-Curtu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Due to the small number of analyzed species and narrow scopes (studies of aeroallergens and honey) studies so far have failed to recognize the potential of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for plant phenotyping. Consequently, the studies have not provided the massive data needed for deducing genetic and evolutionary conclusions. To exploit IR spectra of pollen for plant characterization we have conducted a broad study by the FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. The effect of phylogenetic differences on pollen composition was assessed by measuring the massive sample set of 300 different species, belonging to 53 families in all principal spermatophyte clades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t001">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Table S1 in File S1</xref>). The study has covered five distinct pollination seasons (2009&#x02013;2013), thus enabling assessment of environmental effects on pollen as well.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0095417-t001"

Additional samples of common wind-pollinated species were collected at the facilities of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute and the Faculty of Science of the University of Zagreb.

In FTIR spectroscopy of biological samples the co-linearity between variables is very high, meaning that by a small set of principal components the main variation patterns can be summarized.

As a result, chemical components from a whole grain interacted with IR radiation. On the other hand, reflectance (ATR) measurements were based on intact pollen grains. It is important to note that radii of studied pollen grains varied from less than 10 &#x000b5;m to more than 50 &#x000b5;m. These grain radii are larger than the penetration depth of the IR light, which in reflectance measurement is in the 0.5&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;m range. As a result, the grain wall was in greater interaction with the light than the grain interior. For that reason the obtained reflectance spectra have disproportional bias toward biochemicals present in pollen grain wall. Hence, while for smaller pollens (&#x0003c;15 &#x000b5;m radius) both transmission and reflectance techniques are resulting with comparable biochemical information, for larger pollen grains (&#x0003e;25 &#x000b5;m radius) the obtained spectra from these two techniques can be quite different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig S3 in File S1</xref> for differences between transmission and reflectance spectra).</p><p>One noticeable advantage of transmission measurement compared to reflectance is wider spectral range (up to 400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in transmission and up to 800 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in reflectance spectra), which is due to different optical materials used in the two infrared techniques. However, since pollen spectra are devoid of strong absorption in the 800&#x02013;400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> spectral region, in this regard the actual advantage of transmission measurement is negligible.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Impact of spectral pre-processing on data analysis</title><p>Vibrational spectra of pollen are rich in information on biochemical constituents. However, different spectral bands can often be discriminated only after application of resolution-enhancement techniques, such as conversion of data into derivatives <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. When conversion into derivatives is applied it is imperative that spectral features of biochemical constituents are well understood since this procedure will result with higher suppression of a broad signal than a narrow signal (providing that the signals are of equal amplitudes). Signal bandwidth in mid-IR spectroscopy, usually defined as full width at half-maximum (FWHM), can vary substantially, spanning approximately two orders of magnitude. Regarding the presented pollen spectra, the bandwidths of sporopollenin and lipid bands in 1800&#x02013;1500 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> region are 3&#x02013;5 times smaller than the bandwidths of protein bands. Therefore, conversion of data into second derivative form will highlight spectral variations associated with lipids and sporopollenins. On the other hand, using the original (nonderivated) data will emphasize broad spectral features, such as protein bands in 1700&#x02013;1500 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> spectral region and carbohydrate bands in 1200&#x02013;900 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> region. Consequently, a complete set comprising original and derivative data has been used in the study in order to reduce risk that a substantial part of potentially valuable information is lost.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Pollen composition related to taxonomy</title><p>The extensive and diverse set of measured pollen samples belonging to all major spermatophyte clades has enabled assessment of similarities and differences between closely related species (congeneric and confamiliar), as well as between species that are very far related in historical relationship. The PCA of the second derivatives of transmission IR spectral data shows that the predominant spectral differences are the result of variations of bands associated with lipids, carbohydrates and sporopollenins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2</xref>; see detailed PCA plots in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig S4 in File S1</xref>). The first four PC plots (as a function of wavenumber) have high positive or negative factor loadings associated with lipid bands (in PCs 1 and 2), carbohydrate bands (in PCs 1, 2 and 4), and sporopollenin bands (in PCs 3 and 4). Based on the PCA of the spectral data it is evident that the main biochemical differences arise due to the relative amount of lipids.

Due to clear correlation of spectral features and biochemical constituents quantitative estimation of triglycerides in pollen have been obtained for congenital species of these three genera (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t002">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig. S1 in File S1</xref>). The quantitative estimates reveal that pollen lipids can vary tenfold between minimal and maximal amount. While spectral variations between pollen groups of higher taxonomic levels (genera, families and orders) are associated with a number of different biochemical constituents, congenital variations are predominantly caused only by variations in the relative content of triglycerides. The spectral components associated with triglycerides can be extracted from the data set, in which case spectral variations for congenital species are greatly reduced resulting with enhanced PCA clustering of their spectral data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Therefore, it may be stated as a general rule that the congenital species show clustering of spectral data when spectral features of triglycerides are removed from pollen spectra.

The desiccated nature of grains provides relatively stable biochemical composition, and thus enables simple manipulation and measurement of pollen. Moreover, our results identify biochemical variability of pollen grains at different taxonomical levels; genera, family, order and higher clades. The measurement on <italic>Chamaecyparis</italic> genus samples clearly indicates that spectral variation within species is smaller than the differences between species. This is particularly true when spectral variability associated with triglyceride content is extracted from the data set and disregarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Regarding plasticity, the present study has addressed inter-annual variations in pollen content of samples belonging to the same parent plants. These variations are predominantly expressed as variations in pollen nutrient content in the form of lipids.</p><p>The details on IR methodology, its benefits and constraints, are discussed first. However, the impact of novel findings on plant biology studies is discussed as well, since this study provides the first comparative analysis of pollen biochemical composition.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Method overview</title><p>The presence of unique features in an IR spectrum that correspond to the specific molecular structure is a major reason for broad acceptance of FT-IR spectroscopy for definitive material identification and chemical confirmation. As an analytical tool IR spectroscopic techniques have desirable features, including precision, speed, ease-of-use, minimal or no sample preparation, and the avoidance of sample destruction. The findings presented here are a direct result of conducting study on large and diverse set of plant taxa, and therefore emphasize benefits of low-cost, high throughput and high-dimensional methodology.</p><p>Traditional biochemical analysis of pollen is done by chemical pre-treatment followed by chromatography <xref rid="pone.0095417-Piffanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Piffanelli2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The highly resistant grain walls and an unusual composition with low water content presents severe obstacle for routine analysis of numerous pollen samples. The contemporary pollen analysis is based on transmission electron microscopy of chemically pre-treated samples, and it offers a visual picture of organelles of the pollen grain <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Both approaches are time-consuming, expensive and alter the pollen sample in the pre-treatment process. As opposed to traditional methods, FT-IR spectroscopy is a non-destructive analytical technique that enables measurement of samples as found in nature. Moreover, the direct costs of measurements (including consumables and working hours) are significantly reduced by avoiding chemical pre-treatment. For example, in our study the average time of IR data gathering per sample (including sample preparation and spectral acquisition) was less than three minutes. Finally, IR spectroscopy yields similar, but complementary, information to Raman spectroscopy, a vibrational spectroscopy method that has seen extensive use lately in pollen research <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Schulte1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095417-Schulte3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>The significant problems in infrared measurement of biological samples, such as pollen, are spectral reproducibility and separation of informative signals from non-informative ones. The measured spectra can show strong scatter effects and baseline problems resulting in an inferior spectral reproducibility. These problems, especially present in the transmittance spectra, were addressed by differentiation (transformation into first and second derivatives) and multiplicative signal correction (MSC and EMSC preprocessing). These automated preprocessing methodologies, with high level of standardization, inhibit data errors attributed to instrumentation or personal bias. It should be pointed out that FT-IR spectroscopy offers high measurement reproducibility, especially compared to traditional methods where complex chemical pretreatment, sample separation and human-based analysis leads to considerable intra-sample variability.</p><p>As shown previously, the IR spectoscopy of pollen enables identification of biochemical constituents. It should be emphasized that the general feature of an IR spectrum of pollen is the result of a relative content of structural biochemicals, specifically lipids (triglycerides and phospholipids), carbohydrates (starch and cellulose), sporopollenins, and a variety of proteins. The so-called coding and functional biochemicals, such as nucleic acids and enzymes, are present in pollen in significantly lesser amount than structural biochemicals, and thus constitute minor features of an IR spectrum. As a result, FT-IR measurement of biochemical composition of pollen offers complementary information that is overlooked by genomic and proteomic methods.</p><p>PCA plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g003">3</xref>, S5 and S6 show excellent potential of IR spectral data for various discriminative analyses, such as for taxonomy-based supervised classification as demonstrated previously by our study <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Moreover, the methodology enables numerical analysis and classification of pollen composition in the original spectral form or as latent variables, such as PCA loadings and scores. A spectral component of a biochemical class can be extracted from the data set in order to create partial biochemical classifier, as was demonstrated for triglycerides in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>. In addition, a more precise quantitative estimation of a specific biochemicals can be obtained by signal fitting for congenital species, as demonstrated for triglycerides in pollen belonging to <italic>Iris</italic>, <italic>Quercus</italic> and <italic>Pinus</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t002">Table 2</xref>). Finally, different pre-processing methodologies can provide different information regarding biochemical constituents, such as putting emphasis on narrow sporopollenin bands or broad protein bands by using derivative or original spectra respectively.</p><p>FT-IR spectroscopy lacks qualitative precision of the traditional cytochemical analysis, that can separate sample into individual components (for example with extraction, chromatography and electrophoresis). However, it can provide rapid and economical comparative analysis of a large number of samples with definitive identification of main groups of biochemicals. Specifically, our study has interpreted biochemically the spectral differences related to environment and to taxonomy: 1) large variations of absolute content of triglycerides for congenital species pollinating in the same environmental conditions, indicating the effect of genetic variations on pollen content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2</xref>); 2) noticeable inter-annual variations of pollen trygliceride content for the same parent plants (including clear correlation with climate data), indicating the effect of phenotypic plasticity on pollen content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g005">Fig. 5</xref>); 3) clear correlation between carbohydrate-to-protein ratio and pollination strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g003">Fig. 3</xref>); and 4) clear correlation between cellulose-to-sporopollenin ratio and taxonomy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig S3 in File S1</xref>). It should be emphasized that currently there is no benchmark method for practical assessment and comparative study of pollen composition, due to previously stated experimental difficulties. Therefore, here introduced FT-IR spectroscopy offers, not only simple, fast and reliable plant characterization, but it also enables unique novel insight on plant biochemistry, ecology and evolution.</p><p>The presented FT-IR methodology has ample advantages for rapid worldwide implementation: 1) Available infrastructure and expertise due to widespread use of FT-IR techniques, even in developing countries; 2) Simple, rapid and economical measurement, devoid of any chemical pre-treatment; 3) Semi-automated process of data collection and analysis; 4) Avoidance of specific high-skilled expertise, as opposed to the traditional morphology-based pollen studies; and 5) Attainable remote analysis of pollen spectra due to complete digitalization of data.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Pollen characterization: phylogenetic variations</title><p>In general, the related species have smaller biochemical differences than the unrelated ones, most likely as a result of adaptation of the whole clade to relatively restricted environmental conditions. Consequently, for the related species the analyses show clear clustering of spectral data within rather narrow range, as can be seen for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> for <italic>Poaceae</italic> and <italic>Cyperaceae</italic> pollen data. This property enables rapid identification of the exact family or genera of an unknown pollen sample, as was previously demonstrated for small sample set <xref rid="pone.0095417-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The somewhat larger variations measured in conifers primarily affect <italic>Cupressaceae</italic> pollen samples. Probable cause for outlying spectral features of <italic>Cupressaceae</italic> samples is unusually thick cellulose part of the grain wall (intine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig. S3 in File S1</xref>). The most remarkable feature, however, is similar relative biochemical composition of pollen grains belonging to phylogenetically far-related plant clades, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> for all three principal clades of seed plants. The same general pattern of pollen composition in conifers, monocots and eudicots is predominantly due to large variations in relative amount of lipids.</p><p>Although the application of pollen IR spectra for identification of congenital species has been examined previously <xref rid="pone.0095417-DellAnna1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Pappas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, our study of <italic>Chamaecyparis</italic> species was innovative by taking into consideration the substantial genetic and inter-seasonal variations within species. The finding on <italic>Chamaecyparis</italic> sample set is in agreement with the differentiation of congeneric <italic>Corylus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig S6 in File S1</xref>). This clearly indicates that spectral variation within species is smaller than the differences between species. In addition, it is clear that pollen composition varies to some extent due to seasonal conditions. While the inter-seasonal variations are not impairing the identification of species, it is however detrimental for sub-species identification of cultivars.</p><p>Of particular interest are samples belonging to congenital species that have considerably varied natural habitats as a result of divergent adaptations. For example, the species belonging to <italic>Iris</italic>, <italic>Quercus</italic> and <italic>Pinus</italic> genera are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, ranging from cold latitudes to tropical. Our data shows that the predominant spectral variation in the all three genera is caused by enhanced content of triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095417.s001">Fig. S7 in File S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t002">Table 2</xref>). The extreme variation in relative lipids content observed for these congenital species is remarkable regarding that these individuals have been growing in the same environment (within 100 m radii from each other). For example, the difference in absolute lipids content between <italic>Quercus cerris</italic> (on the higher end) and <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> (on the lower end) is almost tenfold. This is highly unexpected regarding the almost identical morphology, and especially concerning that <italic>Quercus</italic> genus lacks effective genetic isolation that results with frequent hybridization <xref rid="pone.0095417-Curtu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Pollen characterization: phenotypic plasticity</title><p>The inter-annual variations in content of <italic>Pinaceae</italic> pollen samples demonstrate the influence of climate conditions on pollen lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095417-g005">Fig 5</xref>).

Since pollen lipids serve as carbon and energy reserve, it is plausible that an increased storage of pollen lipids is a coping mechanism for countering adverse effects of colder seasons.</p><p>The disruption in flowering patterns in 2013 of the monitored <italic>Pinaceae</italic> individuals, caused by prolonged cold and rainy season, had resulted with surprisingly little effect on pollen composition. The pollen composition in 2011 and 2013 show considerable resemblance, although the pollination start dates in 2013 were shifted for some two weeks. On the other hand, the pollen composition in 2012 shows large deviation from the composition obtained in 2011, although the flowering phenology in the two seasons was quite invariant. Therefore, it is probable that temperature conditions prior to pollination have predominant influence on nutrient composition of pollen. This notion is in agreement with the recent finding that heatwaves have stronger impacts on physiological processes than changing mean climate <xref rid="pone.0095417-Reyer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Impact of IR characterization of pollen on plant biology and ecology</title><p>Reproductive strategy and allocation of resources regarding plant fitness is traditionally researched from the perspective of female functions. Even when male functions are taken into consideration this is almost entirely based on reproduction traits associated with sporophyte generation, such as per-plant pollen production. In contrast, exclusive male traits, such as quality of pollen grains, are mostly overlooked. The traditional modelling of pollen dispersal assumes that mating probability is predominantly affected by distance between potential mating partners. However, recent studies of plant parentage assignment, obtained by DNA microsatellites, have shown that distance explains only a portion of the variation in mating patterns, and often a relatively modest portion <xref rid="pone.0095417-Ashley1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In fact, long-distance pollination is common in anemophilous as well in entomophilous plants. Mean pollination distances are well above mean nearest neighbour distances and possibly even in a range of a few kilometres. The study of an extreme isolated population of <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> has shown that even when a nearest population is tens of kilometres apart, pollination with immigrant pollen is still present <xref rid="pone.0095417-RobledoArnuncio1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Concerning that single tree can produce millions of pollen grains <xref rid="pone.0095417-TormoMolina1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> that could be wind transported for tens of kilometres, it can be expected that individuals producing pollen with increased nutrient content could rapidly propagate these traits throughout a population. As a result, accurate measurement of pollen biochemical composition by IR spectroscopy should offer unique new perspective on reproductive success and total plant fitness.</p><p>Our study has revealed one remarkable feature of pollen composition: An extensive variability of pollen triglyceride content. Pollen triglycerides primarily serve as carbon and long-term energy reserves in the form of intracellular spherical droplets that are termed lipid bodies <xref rid="pone.0095417-Piffanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Piffanelli2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For a long time carbohydrates were considered principal nutrient reserves in mature pollen and were, therefore, extensively studied <xref rid="pone.0095417-Pacini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, as opposed to pollen lipid reserves that gained less interest. However, recent insights reveal that the role of pollen lipids is more important than previously acknowledged <xref rid="pone.0095417-Dinis1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, especially considering that in some species, such as <italic>Olea europea</italic>, the lipid bodies are the only nutrient reserves present in the mature pollen <xref rid="pone.0095417-RodrguezGarca1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. More importantly, pollen lipids have a crucial role in germination and pollen tube growth <xref rid="pone.0095417-RodrguezGarca1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This is of significance from evolutionary standpoint since pollen tube growth is the principal trait in the pollen competition hypothesis. Our findings, that lipid content of pollen is influenced by both genetic and environmental variations, support this hypothesis. It can be assumed that high triglyceride nutrient reserves in pollen, such as those measured in several <italic>Qurcus</italic>, <italic>Pinus</italic> and <italic>Iris</italic> species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095417-t002">Table 2</xref>), play a decisive role during pollination, with a significant effect on pollen siring success. Otherwise the unnecessary waste of valuable biochemicals would quickly result with the elimination of the underlying genetic cause from a population.</p><p>Another interesting result of the IR study is the correlation between pollination strategy and the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. Although it is too soon to conclude if this is anything more than a coincidental result, the finding is supported by the IR spectral features of species showing a double pollination strategy, such as <italic>Quercus</italic> and <italic>Fraxinus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0095417-Giovanetti1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, that display intermediate spectral features. A possible explanation for increased relative content of carbohydrates in anemophilous plants is the vital function of cytoplasmic saccharides in pollen resistance to dehydration. The saccharides, principally starch and sucrose, act as membrane stabilizers <xref rid="pone.0095417-Pacini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095417-Pacini2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and could enable prolonged viability of anemophilous pollen during its airborne transport. Nevertheless, the possible crucial role of cellulose, present in the intine part of the grain wall, cannot be excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The novel findings regarding large variations in nutrient content of pollen, especially in the form of triglycerides, imply that male functions and pollen competition should be incorporated into ecological and evolutionary studies. Biochemically based spectral data enable not only more thorough analysis of pollen than grain morphology by microscopy, but also enable simple, rapid and economic assessment of plant-environment interactions. Moreover, biochemical characterization of pollen can be a valuable tool for trait-based approach in community ecology.</p><p>The infrared spectral data covered by this preliminary study already surpass data on some more prominent plant traits <xref rid="pone.0095417-Kattge1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Development of standardized database of pollen IR spectra would allow rapid expansion of worldwide plant data by the global scientific community, and would serve as a starting point for identification, classification, biochemical characterization and general data mining. Implementation of the global spectral database covering a range of plant samples, with different taxonomical, temporal and spatial origin, should lead to a novel understanding of the plant-environment interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095417.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Included in File S1: Figure S1.
