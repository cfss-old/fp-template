Adult Noda epileptic rats (NER, &#x0003e;12-week-old) exhibit spontaneously generalized tonic-clonic convulsion about once a day. To pursue the involvement of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal in susceptibility to spontaneous seizures, in the present study, the effect of zinc chelators on epileptogenesis was examined using adult NER. Clioquinol (CQ) and TPEN are lipophilic zinc chelotors, transported into the brain and reduce the levels of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The incidence of tonic-clonic convulsion was markedly increased after i.p. injection of CQ (30&#x02013;100 mg/kg) and TPEN (1 mg/kg). The basal levels of extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> measured by ZnAF-2 were decreased before tonic-clonic convulsion was induced with zinc chelators. The hippocampal electroencephalograms during CQ (30 mg/kg)-induced convulsions were similar to those during sound-induced convulsions in NER reported previously. Exocytosis of hippocampal mossy fibers, which was measured with FM4-64, was significantly increased in hippocampal slices from CQ-injected NER that did not show tonic-clonic convulsion yet. These results indicate that the abnormal excitability of mossy fibers is induced prior to epileptic seizures by injection of zinc chelators into NER. The incidence of tonic-clonic convulsion induced with CQ (30 mg/kg) was significantly reduced by co-injection with aminooxyacetic acid (5&#x02013;10 mg/kg), an anticonvulsant drug enhancing GABAergic activity, which did not affect locomotor activity. The present paper demonstrates that the abnormal excitability in the brain, especially in mossy fibers, which is potentially associated with the insufficient GABAergic neuron activity, may be a factor to reduce the threshold for epileptogenesis in NER.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zinc homeostasis in the brain is associated with the etiology and manifestation of epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Sterman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Bitanihirwe1">[2]</xref>.

Although there is no evidence that the decrease modifies susceptibility to epileptic seizures, it is possible that reduction of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> facilitates epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Takeda3">[20]</xref>. However, there are controversial reports on the action of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> in epileptogenesis. In zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) gene-null mice, a strain that lacks zinc in the synaptic vesicle, kainate induces seizures to a similar degree in wild type and ZnT3-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Lee1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, Cole et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Cole1">[21]</xref> report that ZnT3-null mice are more susceptible than wild-type mice to limbic seizures elicited by kainate, suggesting that the net effect of hippocampal Zn<sup>2+</sup> on acute seizures in vivo is inhibitory. Therefore, physiological significance of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal in epileptic seizures, especially in spontaneous seizures remains to be solved.</p><p>Spontaneous seizures contribute to understanding the nature of human epilepsy. Acute loss of Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal by zinc chelators is a reasonable strategy to study the significance of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal in animal models with spontaneous seizures. It is required that zinc chelators do not interfere with the tightly bound zinc pool, such as zinc fingers and numerous catalytic enzymes, which are essential for cellular functions. Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline; CQ) forms lipophilic chelates with cations such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and is a candidate for the transient loss of Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Nitzan1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Andersson1">[23]</xref>. CQ has a relatively weak affinity for zinc (K<sub>d</sub>, approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M). N,N,N&#x02032;,N&#x02032;-Tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylendediamine (TPEN: K<sub>d</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> M) also forms a lipophilic chelate with Zn<sup>2+</sup> and has a strong affinity for zinc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Meeusen1">[24]</xref>. The use of both chelators is a strategy to assess the action of the chelators except for zinc chelation in epileptic seizure.</p><p>Here we examined the effects of acute loss of Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal on epileptogenesis in adult Noda epileptic rats (NER, &#x0003e;12-week-old), which show spontaneous tonic&#x02013;clonic convulsion without any external stimuli once every 30 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Sasa1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Hanaya1">[27]</xref>. The convulsion is characterized by the appearance of high voltage polyspikes in cortical and hippocampal electroencephalograms.

The stain image of the hippocampus by Timm&#x02019;s method, which assesses the levels of vesicular zinc to serve as Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal, was not significantly different between the control (Wistar strain) and NER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071372-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>); the stratum lucidum where mossy fiber terminals from dentate granule cells exist was stained similarly between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071372-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

In the amygdala rapid kindling model, on the other hand, DEDTC decreased the duration of both behavioral seizures and electrical afterdischarges, and also decreased the electroencephalogram spike frequency, without changing the progression of behavioral seizure severity, suggesting that synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> has a facilitatory role during kindling progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Foresti1">[31]</xref>.

On the basis of the controversial evidence on the action of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> in experimentally induced seizures, in the present study, we used NER, a genetic model in epilepsy research to understand synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> function in susceptibility to spontaneous seizures. Adult NER frequently exhibit spontaneous convulsions, controlled by a major autosomal recessive gene for epilepsy, that are comparable to generalized tonic-clonic seizures in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Noda1">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The incidence of tonic-clonic convulsion was markedly increased in NER after i.p. injection of CQ (30 mg/kg) and TPEN (1 mg/kg), which did not induce any convulsion in the control rats (Wistar strain). Both CQ and TPEN decrease intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Nitzan1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Meeusen1">[24]</xref>. The basal levels of extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> measured by ZnAF-2 were decreased before tonic-clonic convulsion was induced with zinc chelators. It is well known that epileptic seizures are closely linked to external stimuli in human. External stimui have been usually used for the analysis on tonic-clonic activity in spontaneous epilepsy animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Noda1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Suzuki1">[33]</xref>. The hippocampal electroencephalogram during CQ (30 mg/kg)-induced convulsion was similar to that during sound-induced convulsions in NER reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Noda1">[26]</xref>. These results suggest that the loss of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> signal with zinc chelators is a factor to induce epileptic seizures in NER. On the other hand, abnormal excitation in epileptic seizures reduces synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels, as well as the total zinc in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Takeda2">[19]</xref>. It is likely that this reduction may also enhance seizure susceptibility as well as the action of zinc chelators. The data that status epilepticus was frequently observed in NER after injection of zinc chelators, unlike the control (vehicle-injected rats) is consistent with the idea. In the present study, two zinc chelators were used to access the actions except for zinc chelation. TPEN has a strong affinity for zinc and the chelation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from proteins with TPEN may reduce cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Meeusen1">[24]</xref>. The dose (5 mg/kg) of TPEN reduced locomotor activity and did not induce any convulsion. The data that vehicle-injected NER showed tonic-clonic convulsion at a low rate proposes an idea that neurotoxicity of lipophilic zinc chelator may influence seizure susceptibility.</p><p>Kiura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Kiura1">[34]</xref> report that calcium channel dysfunction may be involved in the abnormal excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons and pathogenesis of epilepsy in NER. Glutamatergic mossy fibers innervate CA3 pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons. Zn<sup>2+</sup> released from mossy fibers may deceases glutamate release from mossy fibers as a negative feedback factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Bancila1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Minami1">[10]</xref> and may enhance GABAergic neurotransmission system under excessive excitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Takeda4">[35]</xref>. It is reported that Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibits GABA transporter 4, which is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA3 and CA1, and may suppress glutamate-induced excitotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-CohenKfir1">[36]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the loss of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> with zinc chelators induces the imbalance of excitation-inhibition at mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. Exocytosis of mossy fibers from dentate granule cells, which measured with FM4-64, was significantly increased in hippocampal slices prepared 2 h after CQ injection when tonic-clonic convulsion was not observed yet. The present paper is the first to demonstrate that the abnormal excitability of mossy fibers is induced prior to epileptic seizures by injection of zinc chelators into NER. However, zinc chelators act on the whole brain and nonspecifically reduce synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the brain. It is possible that the changes in other brain regions except for the hippocampus are required for epileptogenesis.</p><p>Any drug that has an anticonvulsant action can suppress seizures. The drugs often affect locomotor activity and induce immobilized and/or sleepy situations. If seizure susceptibility is linked to abnormal glutamatergic neuron activity, excess of GABAergic neuron activity may be required to suppress epileptic seizures, followed by the affected locomotor activity with the drugs. The locomotor activity is an index to assess physiological brain function. The doses (5&#x02013;10 mg/kg) of AOAA that did not affect the locomotor activity suppressed epileptic seizures, suggesting that the insufficient GABAergic neuron activity is associated with abnormal glutamatergic neuron activity.</p><p>In conclusion, seizure susceptibility was enhanced selectively in NER after administration of zinc chelators. This selectivity is an important evidence to understand the epileptogenesis in NER. On the other hand, the imbalance of excitation and inhibition, i.e., the abnormal glutamatergic neuron activity can be induced even in the control rats treated with zinc chelator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Minami1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Takeda3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Takeda4">[35]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the extent of excessive glutamatergic neuron activity through the loss of synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> with zinc chelators is different between wild type (Wistar) rat and NER. Knock-out of zinc transporters Zip-1 and Zip-3 exhibits a lower seizure threshold to kainate, suggesting that Zn<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis via the zinc transporters is involved in seizure severity induced with kainate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071372-Qian2">[37]</xref>. The present paper demonstrates that the abnormal excitability in the brain, especially in mossy fibers, which is potentially associated with the insufficient GABAergic neuron activity, may be a factor to reduce the threshold for epileptogenesis in NER.
