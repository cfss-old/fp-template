Typical problems with mixed cultures on scale are unrestrained growth of one bacterium, which leads to suboptimal population ratios, and lack of control over bacterial spatial distribution, which leads to inefficient substrate transport. To address these issues, we designed and produced a synthetic ecosystem by co-encapsulation in a silica gel matrix, which enabled precise control of the microbial populations and their microenvironment. As a case study, two greatly different microorganisms: <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. NCIB 9816 and <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 were encapsulated. NCIB 9816 can aerobically biotransform over 100 aromatic hydrocarbons, a feat useful for synthesis of higher value commodity chemicals or environmental remediation. In our system, NCIB 9816 was used for biotransformation of naphthalene (a model substrate) into CO<sub>2</sub> and the cyanobacterium PCC 7942 was used to provide the necessary oxygen for the biotransformation reactions via photosynthesis. A mathematical model was constructed to determine the critical cell density parameter to maximize oxygen production, and was then used to maximize the biotransformation rate of the system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Pure cultures of naturally-occurring or recombinant microorganisms are used for biotransformation of chemicals at large scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, most prominently in renewable energy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, pharmaceutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, agriculture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and environmental remediation industries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. More recently, applications of mixed bacterial populations are being sought for commercial use, drawing on the ability of communities to perform a larger variety of more complicated tasks than individual species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. A major challenge in utilizing multiple bacterial species cooperatively in a complex chemical transformation reaction is to establish temporal population stability and to preserve the spatial distribution characteristics within the system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In consortia or mixtures, interspecies competition may lead to an imbalance in population distribution, reducing efficacy and yield, and may even result in a complete termination of the process if one of the species is eradicated.</p><p>Aromatic hydrocarbons are major industrial feedstock chemicals and also environmental pollutants, therefore their biotransformation is important for both chemical synthesis and remediation applications. Aromatic hydrocarbons are oxidized to higher value products (<italic>e.g</italic>. phenols, benzoates, phthalates, quinones, hydroquinones, dyes), and biotransformation has a higher conversion efficiency than chemical transformation. However, the higher oxygenation demand of biotransformation makes it economically unfavorable for synthesis of these products. On the other hand, aromatic hydrocarbons with polycyclic rings (PAHs) are prominent carcinogens and EPA priority pollutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and therefore are top targets for water or soil remediation. Bioremediation of PAHs is shown to be feasible using <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. NCIB 9816<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, but the process requires continuous oxygenation via mechanical aeration. Aeration can account for more than 50% of the overall energy consumption in a typical bioremediation processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, making bioremediation economically less feasible.</p><p>In this communication, we designed and produced a synthetic self-sustaining ecosystem where cyanobacteria, <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942, provided the necessary oxygen for NCIB 9816 to biotransform aromatic hydrocarbons, eliminating external oxygenation requirement. PCC 7942 and NCIB 9816 were encapsulated in an optically transparent, highly porous, and mechanically sturdy silica gel for synergistic biotransformation of naphthalene to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Silica gel encapsulation of whole cells (eukaryotes and prokaryotes) has been studied in the literature, and is proven to be an effective tool for utilizing and studying cells in physical confinement, as summarized in review articles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. NCIB 9816 is known to aerobically transform over 100 aromatic hydrocarbons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, thus has a wide range of potential applications in chemical synthesis and remediation.</p><p>We engineered the system to maximize the combined activity of NCIB 9816 and PCC 7942 populations, while ensuring ease of integration into existing industrial processes. In almost all bioencapsulation systems, cells constitute the major proportion of the overall cost. Thus, encapsulated cell densities were optimized to maximize the biotransformation rate while minimizing the required amount of cells. The silica gel was further optimized for mechanical stability, cytocompatibility and optical transparency. Light attenuation (due to absorption and scattering effects of the encapsulating gel and the cells within) in the silica gel matrix was modeled, and experimentally verified by measuring the oxygen generation rates of the encapsulated PCC 7942 at various cell densities. This model was used to determine the geometry-dependent critical cell density parameter, which maximized total oxygen generation rate. Using this parameter, loading density of NCIB 9816 was optimized and the biotransformation performance of the system was experimentally verified. The developed ecosystem was able to sustain biotransformation reactions after the dissolved oxygen in the medium was depleted. Furthermore, it was shown that photosynthetic oxygenation via co-encapsulated PCC 7942 in very close proximity to NCIB 9816 was more efficient than external aeration due to micron scale diffusion length-scale between the co-encapsulated cells. Confocal microscopy was used to verify homogeneous distribution of the cells within close proximity.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Material design and characterization</title><p>Silica gels were synthesized using two precursors: Tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si alkoxide) and aqueous silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The volumetric ratio of the two silica precursors (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;Si alkoxide/(Si alkoxide&#x02009;+&#x02009;SNP)), and the diameter of the SNPs were varied to optimize the mechanical and optical properties of the silica gels. Optical properties of the silica gels varied considerably with the size of SNPs used. Gels made with HS40 (12&#x02009;nm in diameter) and TM40 (22&#x02009;nm) SNPs were visibly transparent, while NS85-40 (55&#x02009;nm) and NS125-40 (85&#x02009;nm) gels were opaque, independent of &#x003b1;. Since optical transparency is crucial for efficient oxygen generation, NS85-40 and NS125-40 gels were excluded from the study. Transparent gels synthesized with HS40 and TM40 SNPs were further characterized using UV-Vis spectrophotometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the entire photosynthetically active spectral range (PAR, 400&#x02013;700&#x02009;nm), transmittance (ratio of transmitted light to received light) in the gels synthesized with smaller (HS40) SNPs was higher than that of gels synthesized with larger (TM40) SNPs. The wavelength of 680&#x02009;nm was selected for characterization studies as it is the maximum absorption wavelength for Photosystem II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, where oxygen evolving complex is located in cyanobacteria. It was further observed that transmittance of TM40 gels decreased gradually as &#x003b1; decreased, while that of HS40 gels were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This was attributed to formation of silica aggregates by the Si alkoxide during gelation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These aggregates were smaller than the TM40 SNPs but comparable in size to the HS40 SNPs, thus they did not affect the optical properties of the HS40 gels.</p><p>The gel with the best mechanical properties (HS40/&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5) had an elastic modulus of 8.79&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.72&#x02009;MPa and a stress at failure of 380&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;34&#x02009;kPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). HS40 gels had higher mechanical properties as compared to the TM40 gels, for all &#x003b1; values tested, which is due to the higher crosslinking density of the smaller nanoparticles. HS40 gels were also superior to TM40 gels in terms of optical transparency, thus TM40 gels were not further investigated. Mechanical properties (elastic modulus and stress at failure) of the gels declined as &#x003b1; decreased. This is in accordance with previously reported results that increasing Si alkoxide content of the gel improves its mechanical properties, albeit reducing the viability of the encapsulated biocatalytic bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In that system the encapsulated bacteria were recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> overexpressing a catalytic enzyme, and cell viability was not essential. However, in this system NCIB 9816 and PCC 7942 must both be viable to carry out biotransformation and photosynthesis, respectively. Thus, we proceeded with measuring their post-encapsulation biological activity with respect to &#x003b1;.</p><p>Activity of encapsulated PCC 7942 was evaluated by measuring its oxygen generation rate. The rate increased significantly when &#x003b1; decreased from 0.5 to 0.25, and plateaued around 4.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;nmoles/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Conversely, activity of the silica gel encapsulated NCIB 9816 was evaluated by measuring oxygen depletion in the supernatant due to biotransformation of a saturated naphthalene solution. The naphthalene-dependent oxygen consumption rate of encapsulated NCIB 9816 increased significantly from &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5 to 0.25, and a maximum of 45.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6&#x02009;nmoles/min was achieved at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These results verified that a compromise was necessary between the cytocompatibility and the mechanical properties of the gel. HS40/&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25 gels had very small loss in oxygen generation (with PCC 7942) and biotransformation (with NCIB 9816) activity, and maintained better mechanical properties as compared to the other cytocompatible (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16 and 0.12) gels. While the mechanical properties of all the tested silica gel formulations were sufficiently high for our experiments, we opted to use HS40/&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25 gel for modeling and optimization purposes to facilitate its potential use in a scaled-up biotransformation application.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modeling of oxygen generation and consumption</title><p>A mathematical model was constructed to analyze oxygen generation by encapsulated PCC 7942 as a function of cell density (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>) and distribution of light intensity (<italic>I</italic>) in the silica gel. Light intensity varies through the gel as both the silica gel and the encapsulated bacteria within contribute to light attenuation (<italic>At</italic>) via absorption and scattering. Spatial attenuation in one dimensional solutions in photobioreactors (where bacteria are freely suspended in media) has been extensively studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and is typically modeled by the Beer-Lambert law:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e275" xlink:href="srep27404-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where attenuation coefficient <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> represents the contribution of cells to light attenuation, <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> is the cell density (of the photosynthetic bacteria), and <italic>x</italic> is the pathlength of light in the cell suspension.

It was observed that light attenuation through free and encapsulated cell volumes were very similar, indicating that the optical transparency of the designed gel (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.089 1/cm) was sufficiently high and the major contribution to light attenuation in the gel was due to cells (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;116.42&#x02009;mL/(mL cells-cm)). Thus, the cell density and light penetration are inversely correlated and contribution of each bacterium to overall oxygen generation decreases along the pathlength (due to increased attenuation), potentially reaching zero at a critical distance from the surface. Using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq10">Equation (1b)</xref>, transmittance (<italic>T</italic>) at a distance <italic>x</italic> from the gel surface for encapsulated PCC 7942 was determined as:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq3"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e336" xlink:href="srep27404-m3.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>Note that <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> is the light intensity at the gel surface, which depends only on the light source characteristics. Since the light source in the experimental setup was fixed, light transmittance profile (<italic>T&#x02009;=&#x02009;I/I</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) was used instead of the absolute light intensity (<italic>I</italic>) in the calculations, for simplicity.</p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq10">Equation (2)</xref>, two volume elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) for cells encapsulated in a silica gel of uniform cross-section (UCS) and non-uniform (cylindrical) cross-section (NUCS) were defined. The UCS volume element was used for the derivation of an analytical solution of the critical cell density parameter and optimization of the cell densities for the synergistic biotransformation study. The NUCS volume element was used for the characterization of oxygen generation by the encapsulated cells in the Oxygraph chamber, where cylindrical samples were used. For UCS, a differential volume can be defined as:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq4"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e364" xlink:href="srep27404-m4.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>A</italic> is the uniform cross-sectional area (the differential volume definition and the derivation of the following equations for NUCS is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental information</xref>).

If <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> is increased beyond this critical point, additional PCC 7942 cannot provide more oxygen for the biotransformation reactions, yielding an oxygen deficit (<inline-formula id="d33e642"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e643" xlink:href="srep27404-m12.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p><p>Model analysis (in the previous section) showed that maximum oxygen generation rate was achieved at a critical PCC 7942 cell density: <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub><italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x003c1;</italic><sub><italic>cr</italic></sub>. It is clear that in order to maximize the biotransformation rate of the system, the density of PCC 7942 should be set to <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub><italic>cr</italic></sub>, and based on the optimization study the density of NCIB 9816 should be at <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub><italic>N</italic>,</sub> which yields <inline-formula id="d33e672"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e673" xlink:href="srep27404-m13.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

The efficiency of oxygenation can be calculated by considering a hypothetical case with no light attenuation in the gel (either by the gel or cells), where all the PCC 7942 generate oxygen at the maximum rate (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>gen</italic></sub>). In such a case, the NCIB 9816 to PCC 7942 cell ratio would be equal to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>gen</italic></sub><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>deg</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04. Since 0.04 is the highest that this ratio can be, an efficiency factor can be calculated as: <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01/0.04&#x02009;=&#x02009;25%. This result means that if the cells were co-encapsulated in an extremely thin gel with a single cell layer, one fourth of the encapsulated PCC 7942 would be sufficient to supply the same amount of oxygen. In our experiment setup, the strong hydrophilic interactions between the gel and the glass surface made it difficult to obtain a very thin gel with uniform thickness. Thus, experimental parameters were kept constant despite the low oxygenation efficiency.</p><p>Naphthalene biotransformation experiments with silica gel co-encapsulated cells were conducted as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>. Four cases were tested: (I) <underline>No cells</underline>: Silica gel without cells, (II) <underline>NCIB 9816</underline>: Silica gel encapsulated NCIB 9816, (III) <underline>NCIB 9816 with air</underline>: Silica gel encapsulated NCIB 9816 with additional headspace which provides additional oxygen for biotransformation reactions and (IV) <underline>NCIB 9816 with PCC 7942</underline>: Silica gel co-encapsulated NCIB 9816 and PCC 7942. Based on oxygen consumption experiments of a scaled-down system, the point where the dissolved oxygen concentration in the solution was expected to be depleted was approximately 4&#x02009;hours. Thus, the time points were selected as 4 and 24&#x02009;hours for the naphthalene biotransformation experiment. In Case I, naphthalene concentration decreased only slightly over 24&#x02009;hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), verifying that the disappearance of naphthalene due to effects other than biotransformation was minimal. For cases II, III and IV, naphthalene concentrations were comparable after 4&#x02009;hours at 52.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1%, 49.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.9% and 43.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.6% respectively. These values indicated that when a sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen was present in the solution, oxygen generation by encapsulated cyanobacteria did not make a difference. At 24&#x02009;hours, the naphthalene concentrations in cases II and III were still comparable, whereas the naphthalene concentration for case IV was measured as 16.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3%, which was significantly lower than cases II and III. This indicated that dissolved oxygen was depleted in solution sometime between 4 and 24&#x02009;hours, and after the depletion of dissolved oxygen, PCC 7942 provided oxygen to further drive the biotransformation reactions.</p><p>Experimental results also verified that oxygenation via co-encapsulated PCC 7942 (Case IV) was more efficient than providing oxygen externally (Case III). Oxygenation of a bioreactor using photosynthetic microorganisms was previously tested in spatially unstructured environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, but was shown to limit the biotransformation rate. In our system, we observed the opposite result due to the optimized and stabilized cell densities, as well as close spatial distribution of the cells. It should be noted that an aeration system which provides air directly into the solution could perform better than Case III, since it eliminates the partitioning limitation of oxygen from air to solution. However, this condition was not tested since naphthalene is a very volatile chemical and ensuring that it would stay in the solution in an open system was not feasible. In our experiment, approximately 60 to 70% of the naphthalene was transformed with the amount of dissolved oxygen in water (Case II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Dissolved oxygen in water at room temperature (260&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) can be utilized to transform approximately 15% of a saturated (246&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) naphthalene solution into CO<sub>2</sub> (based on 7.5&#x02009;moles of O<sub>2</sub> per mole of naphthalene as previously reporte<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This suggests that some partial transformation of naphthalene to intermediate species occurred without complete transformation.</p><p>Densities of PCC 7942 and NCIB 9816 were optimized based on their activity immediately after encapsulation, thus the biotransformation activity of the system was measured in a short time period (24&#x02009;hours). It is known that the activity of encapsulated bacteria can vary over time, even when cell growth in the encapsulation matrix is restricted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In addition, in our particular case a mutualistic relationship is expected to form between PCC 7942 and NCIB 9816, since CO<sub>2</sub> is essential for carbon fixation by PCC 7942. Thus, oxygen generation by PCC 7942 will be regulated by the biotransformation rate of NCIB 9816, and vice versa. It is expected that due to the temporal changes in activity and formation of a mutualistic relationship, the optimal cell densities can change during long-term use of the system. However, cell densities can still be optimized using the tools presented in this study, depending on the specific biotransformation (e.g. synthesis yield, degradation rate, etc.) goals of the application.</p><p>In summary, in this study we developed a synthetic ecosystem via 3D co-encapsulation of two bacterial populations in a silica gel matrix for synergistic biotransformation. This technology has various immediate applications in chemical synthesis and environmental remediation, but could also be used in biomedical or biosensing applications. The potential to use silica gel encapsulated bacteria as biosensors is reported in the literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and co-encapsulation of multiple species can amplify this potential. We expect that co-encapsulated species could either act as a supporting organism to the primary sensory species, or work successively to biotransform a sensory input (<italic>e.g</italic>. chemical) into a signal (<italic>e.g</italic>. light). This technology could also be utilized as a platform to study fundamental microbial behavior. It has been long known that bacteria can act as a community via quorum sensing, and more recently interspecies quorum sensing was reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. A synthetic ecosystem could provide a unique method to study this communication by enabling precise adjustment of bacterial communities&#x02019; volume and proximity.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>Reagent grade tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%) and Ludox HS-40/TM-40 colloidal silica nanoparticles (SNP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.
