Invading fibroblasts contribute to fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and the initiation, progression, or resistance of cancer. To construct transcriptome-wide signatures of fibroblast invasion, we used a multiplex phenotypic 3D invasion assay using lung fibroblasts. Microarray-based gene expression profiles of invading and non-invading fibroblasts demonstrated that 1,049 genes were differentially regulated (&#x0003e;1.5-fold). Unbiased pathway analysis (Ingenuity) identified significant enrichment for the functional clusters &#x02018;invasion of cells&#x02019;, &#x02018;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&#x02019;, and &#x02018;metastasis&#x02019;. Matrix metalloprotease 13 (MMP13), transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1, Caveolin (Cav) 1, Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (Pten), and secreted frizzled-related protein (Sfrp) 1 were among the highest regulated genes, confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. We next performed <italic>in silico</italic> analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) to predict mediators that induced fibroblast invasion. Of these, TGF&#x003b2;1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were tested in our 3D invasion assay and found to significantly induce invasion, thus validating the transcriptome profile. Accordingly, our transcriptomic invasion signature describes the invading fibroblast phenotype in unprecedented detail and provides a tool for future functional studies of cell invasion and therapeutic modulation thereof using complex phenotypic assays.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Fibroblast invasion through interstitial tissue is one substantial step in the dynamic process of tissue remodelling and repair, a process that also plays a pivotal role in fibrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, carcinogenesis, and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Cell migration through the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of most tissues, in particular the lung, requires an invading phenotype that enables fibroblasts to penetrate the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cross the basal membrane. This migratory program is an inherent feature of many cells, such as fibroblasts or leukocytes, yet it can also be specifically increased during inflammation or tissue wounding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Importantly, the mode of interstitial migration differs between various cell types: leukocytes are mainly found to display an integrin-independent amoeboid mode of migration, while most cancer cells and fibroblasts display mesenchymal movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>In tissue fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), areas of activated fibroblasts, are believed to represent the site of increased production, secretion, and deposition of ECM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In the lung, &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA)-positive fibroblasts originate from the sub-pleural region and form a fibroblastic reticular structure into the interstitium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. It is widely assumed that this process requires an invading fibroblast phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. During injury, repair, and fibrosis, a plethora of soluble mediators are released by different cell types, which activate and attract resident fibroblasts and/or induce transformation of epithelial or pleural mesothelial cells (PMC) into mesenchymal-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Such aberrantly activated mesenchymal cells exhibit an exceptional plasticity with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, ECM deposition, activation, and tissue invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In agreement with this concept, an increased collagen-invading capacity of human lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients has recently been reported in 2D assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, keloid fibroblasts are suggested to exhibit a highly invasive character, inducing infiltration of these fibroblasts into surrounding healthy skin tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Enhanced fibroblast invasion, however, does play a decisive role in carcinogenesis and metastasis, as the tumour microenvironment is increasingly recognized as a major feature of tumour progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Here, the crosstalk between cancer cells and cells of the neoplastic stroma are important factors for invasive tumour growth and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In particular, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) have been reported to represent key determinants in cancer progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Studies using squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells and stromal fibroblasts revealed that force- and protease-mediated matrix remodelling by the fibroblast is required for collective invasion of the SCC cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, indicating that invading fibroblasts are able to direct carcinoma cells through stromal tissue.</p><p>In the current study, we hypothesized that pathway analysis of the transcriptome-wide signature of invading lung fibroblasts by comparative microarray analyses, using a collagen-based invasion assay previously established in our lab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, will identify pro-invasive growth factors with relevance to disease. To this end, we generated a specific fibroblast invasion signature, followed by functional validation of <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted upstream regulators of fibroblast invasion; namely transforming growth factor (TGF)&#x003b2;1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB. Prospectively, this validated fibroblast invasion signature will enable the identification of yet unknown invasion-relevant molecular networks and underlying mechanisms thereof. Thus, this invasion signature advances the understanding of an activated invasive fibroblast phenotype in particular for fibrotic and metastatic pathologies.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results Section</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Deciphering a transcriptomic signature for invading fibroblasts</title><p>In order to systematically identify the molecular signature of invading fibroblasts we applied a whole transcriptome analysis (Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array), using our recently established 3D invasion assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. A subpopulation of murine MLg 2908 (MLg) lung fibroblasts spontaneously invaded a 3D collagen matrix when plated on top of it<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Separation of invading from non-invading MLg fibroblasts was carried out 72 or 96&#x02009;hours after plating. RNA isolation and subsequent whole transcriptome analysis provided gene expression profiles of invading and non-invading fibroblasts. Transcripts with a false discovery rate &#x0003c;10% were considered as being statistically significant regulated and were used for subsequent analyses. After 72&#x02009;hours of invasion, 1,086 targets with expression ratios greater than 1.5-fold and 163 targets regulated greater than 2-fold were identified in the invading fraction as compared to the non-invading fraction. In fibroblasts that invaded the matrix for 96&#x02009;hours, an altered regulation of 1,049 probes with expression ratios greater than 1.5-fold and 182 greater than 2-fold were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of the different fractions is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>. Heatmaps of up- and down-regulated target genes (&#x0003e;2-fold) in the invading fractions at 72&#x02009;hours and 96&#x02009;hours validate the reproducibility of our replicate analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The whole array data have been submitted to GEO (GSE55322).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Predictive <italic>in silico</italic> cluster analysis and validation of the gene expression profile of fibroblast invasion</title><p>The gene expression profiles of the invading fibroblasts at 72&#x02009;hours and 96&#x02009;hours (&#x0003e;1.5-fold) greatly overlapped: among the differentially regulated genes in the invading subtype at 72 and 96&#x02009;hours, 621 genes overlapped in total: 166 in the up- and 455 in the down-regulated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Of note, there were more than twice as many overlapping down-regulated genes than overlapping up-regulated genes. This comparative approach allowed us to enrich for those targets that are commonly regulated after 72 and 96&#x02009;hours of invasion and to define the invasion signature of fibroblasts. Enrichment analyses using IPA&#x02019;s &#x02018;disease and function&#x02019; ontology revealed that &#x02018;invasion of cells&#x02019;, &#x02018;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)&#x02019;, and &#x02018;metastasis&#x02019; ranked as the top three most significantly over-represented &#x02018;disease processes&#x02019; and &#x02018;biological functions&#x02019; within the invasion signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In agreement with the well-known role of TGF&#x003b2;1 in invasion and fibrosis, TGF&#x003b2;1 associated with all three key networks of invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data clearly corroborate our experimental approach. In order to further validate the profiling approach used, several known invasion-promoting genes were chosen for confirmative expression analysis by qRT-PCR. These targets included matrix metalloprotease 13 (MMP13)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, TGF&#x003b2;1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, Caveolin 1 (Cav1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, secreted frizzled-related protein (Sfrp) 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (Pten)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Consistent with our microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated a significant up-regulation of MMP13 and TGF&#x003b2;1 in the invading fibroblasts by 6- and 1.8-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). By contrast, Cav1, Sfrp1, and Pten were significantly down-regulated by 3.5-, 2.9-, and 2.6-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Reduced Sfrp1 and Cav1 protein expression was further corroborated by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Furthermore, TGF&#x003b2;1 and MMP13<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> were up-regulated on protein level as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Interestingly, the protein expression of Pten, which was strongly diminished on transcript level, was found to be largely unchanged. Additionally, in primary human lung fibroblasts we identified a corresponding regulation of the same target genes in the invading subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). The qRT-PCR analyses of selected target genes thus validated the robustness of our invasion assay and the identified gene signature for invading fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification and validation of upstream regulators for fibroblast invasion</title><p>In order to further validate the generated transcriptomic fibroblast invasion signature, gene expression lists were evaluated with the causal analysis tool &#x02018;upstream regulator analysis&#x02019; (URA), implemented in IPA. This approach allowed the identification of putative upstream regulators for subsequent functional testing in regards to fibroblast invasion. In order to measure the enrichment of potentially activated upstream regulators we used a ranking based on the p-value<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> obtained from the overlap between our experimentally derived gene datasets and those from the IPA&#x02019;s database. As physiological upstream regulators were of particular interest, we excluded &#x02018;drugs&#x02019;, and &#x02018;chemicals&#x02019; from the URA. The &#x02018;p-value of overlap&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Table 1</xref> depicts a ranking of physiological upstream regulators according to their p-values for the comparison of gene expression data at 72 and 96 hours upon invasion. The cut-off value for the ranking (negative logarithmic p-value) was set to 4. By using a more stringent filter for &#x02018;growth factors&#x02019;, we were able to extract four growth factors, which all were found to be associated with fibrotic and/or cancerous diseases in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, TGF&#x003b2;1, which is a prominent and potent activator of fibroblasts, ranked high among the predicted upstream regulators (p-value <sup>96&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;3.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>, p-value <sup>72&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;1.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). In line with its key role in fibrogenesis, in the microarrays we found the expression of TGF&#x003b2;1 to be significantly increased in the invading fibroblast fraction and moreover, also predicted to be associated with the generated functional gene clusters &#x02018;IPF&#x02019;, &#x02018;invasion of cells&#x02019;, and &#x02018;metastasis&#x02019; in the <italic>in silico</italic> gene cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Further putative upstream regulators from the URA, which were chosen for functional analysis in the following due to their association to fibrotic and cancerous diseases, comprised epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB. EGF, was predictively activated in the invading fibroblast fraction with a p-value <sup>96&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;10.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> and a p-value <sup>72&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;4.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>), while its receptor EGFR was also predicted to be activated (p-value <sup>96&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;6.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> and a p-value <sup>72&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;4.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). In our transcriptomic invasion signature, FGF2 was another highly ranked candidate in the predicted list of upstream regulators (p-value <sup>96&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;7.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and p-value <sup>72&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;2.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), which was associated with fibrotic or cancerous diseases. Furthermore, PDGF-BB was predicted to be activated based on the invasion signature with p-value <sup>96&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;3.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> and a p-value <sup>72&#x02009;hours&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;2.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. Grounded on these computational predictions of activated upstream regulators, we next performed functional confirmative studies <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, the invasive capacity of MLg fibroblasts was assessed by using the automated software-based invasion assay recently established in our lab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The fibroblasts were treated with the particular growth factor and the invasion capacity was measured after 72&#x02009;hours total invasion time as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. TGF&#x003b2;1 (1 and 5&#x02009;ng/ml) significantly enhanced the fibroblast invasion capacity to 138.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;28.7% (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01) and 141.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;38.1% (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01), compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). EGF (10 and 50&#x02009;ng/ml) significantly increased the cellular invasion to 178&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;57.0% and 193.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;64.2% (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). FGF2 exhibited the strongest significant effect on the invasion capacity with a mean relative induction of 246.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;58.9% (10&#x02009;ng/ml) (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) and 235.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;64.2% (50&#x02009;ng/ml) (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). PDGF-BB (5 and 25&#x02009;ng/ml) initiated a significant effect of 114.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17.6% (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) and 134.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23.0% (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001) relative invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> depicts representative images of either untreated or TGF&#x003b2;1-, and FGF2-treated fibroblasts invading the collagen gel. Next, we used immunoblot analyses to demonstrate expression of the receptors for the above identified growth factors in lung fibroblasts. Protein expression of TGF&#x003b2;RI and II, EGFR, FGFR1 and 2, as well as PDGFR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; was assessed in fibroblasts cultured on the 3D collagen matrix at the time of cell treatment. In addition, the expression levels of these receptors upon invasion were extracted from the microarray data for 72 and 96&#x02009;hours of invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). While mRNA expression levels of TGF&#x003b2;RII and EGFR were detected but significantly reduced in invading cells at both time-points, FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNA levels were increased. PDGFR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; were expressed, but unchanged during invasion. Taken together, we have generated and identified, using a novel high content 3D invasion assay, a specific transcriptome signature of fibroblast invasion that shows a strong relation to invasive diseases, such as fibrosis and cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The dynamic processes of tissue remodelling and repair that take place as a physiological response to tissue injury depend on an active and versatile fibroblast phenotype that ultimately restores normal tissue architecture and homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

One substantial feature of activated fibroblasts is their increased invasive capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The herein identified invasion signature included several genes that were previously reported to play essential roles for cellular invasion. In the expression profile of the invading fibroblast, the interstitial collagenase MMP13 and TGF&#x003b2;1 were found to be significantly up-regulated while Cav1, Pten, and Sfrp1 were down-regulated on mRNA level. Finding MMP13 as one of the most highly up-regulated transcript in the invasion signature indicates that ECM degradation likely assists in the process of fibroblast invasion in the 3D invasion model. In a pathophysiological context, MMP13 expression in invading fibroblasts was found to not only drive their own invasion, but also influences the invasive capacity of carcinoma cells as indicated by MMP13 expression in subsets of activated carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

Furthermore, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin-mediated invasion of lung fibroblasts was found to be circumvented through the reactivation of Pten activity by &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Pten also acts as stabilizer of junctional complexes in epithelial kidney cells, thereby preventing transformation to an invasive phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Furthermore, Pten was reported to suppress 2D cell migration and invasion in Boyden chamber <italic>in vitro</italic> assays in fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Interestingly, using our 3D invasion assay, protein expression of Pten did not correlate with the down-regulation of Pten on transcript level upon invasion, but remained unchanged when comparing invading with non-invading fibroblasts. This could advocate a more complex regulation of protein expression of Pten on various levels, including translation, protein stability and its turnover, or epigenetic mechanisms, all of which might be altered upon cellular invasion. Actually, the expression of Pten was reported to be regulated by miR-18a in a stiffness-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, which could influence and alter its expression levels when using soft 3D matrices, such as collagen I. In IPF, down-regulation of Pten in fibroblastic foci was found to be accompanied by decreased Caveolin 1 (Cav1) levels. Diminished Cav1 thereby reduce membrane-associated Pten, which in turn favours the activation of PI3K/Akt signal pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Furthermore, Sfrp1 was found to be down-regulated upon fibroblast invasion. Sfrps are a family of glycoproteins that can trigger Wnt signalling cascades by binding to Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Transcriptional silencing of Sfrp1 was previously reported in non-small cell lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and in fibroblasts derived from keloid lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, and IPF fibrotic lungs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In breast cancer, ectopic expression of Sfrp1 in highly invasive human derived MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells decreased the migratory potential of the cells and impaired tumour outgrowth, and blocked lung metastases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Reduction of Sfrp1 expression by TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment with a concomitant increase in cell invasion and migration was reported in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We also identified TGF&#x003b2;1, one of the best characterized profibrotic mediators, to be up-regulated in the invasion signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Here, TGF&#x003b2;1 was found to be predictively associated with the functional clusters &#x02018;invasion of cell&#x02019;, &#x02018;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)&#x02019;, and &#x02018;metastasis&#x02019;. As the mere expression level of upstream regulators such as TGF&#x003b2;1 was found to be significantly higher in invading fibroblasts, we aimed to validate the functional relevance of the generated invasion signature by using a systematic approach (Upstream Regulator Analysis (URA), Ingenuity). URA has frequently been used in the literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. URA enables to elucidate upstream biological causes to gene-expression datasets and thus allows interpretation of gene expression data beyond gene cluster enrichment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Using such causal networks in order to identify biological cause-effect relationships based on gene expression data is more powerful and relevant than looking at changes in gene expression levels alone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The URA of differentially expressed genes comparing invading to non-invading fibroblasts provided us with an activation list of upstream regulators of various molecule types such as cytokines, chemical drugs, kinases, transcriptional regulators, growth factors, and others. The activation of the upstream regulators is entirely based on prediction grounded on the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, which is a large collection assembled from already published findings or third-party databases. Therefore, from the list of predictively activated upstream regulators, we functionally tested several cancer- and/or fibrosis-associated growth factors in our 3D invasion assay. Consistent with the URA prediction of our experimentally derived invasion signature, TGF&#x003b2;1 induced fibroblast invasion. Taking into consideration that activated, invading fibroblasts in the 3D invasion model express higher levels of TGF&#x003b2;1, this invading fibroblast phenotype may initiate the activation of adjuvant fibroblasts in a pathophysiological context. Besides TGF&#x003b2;1, the identification and functional verification of additional cancer or fibrosis-associated factors, EGF, FGF2 and PDGF-BB, further confirmed the functional relevance of the invasion signature. In fibrotic and cancerous diseases, epidermal growth factor (EGF) represents one potent inducer of cellular invasion, which was also shown for breast and prostate cancer cells, oral carcinoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and human dermal fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Moreover, FGF2 was reported to be highly expressed in osteosarcoma-associated stromal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, and the expression of FGF2 was shown to be enhanced in renal fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> as well as in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of IPF patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Furthermore, the inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, the predominant receptor for FGF2, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis in a rodent model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Another highly ranked candidate predicted to be an activated upstream regulator in our transcriptomic invasion signature was PDGF-BB. Most recently, PDGF-BB/PDGFR-&#x003b2; signalling was reported to contribute to fibrocyte migration in pulmonary fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. In addition, an involvement of this signalling cascade was suggested for cervical cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Furthermore, it was suggested that cancer cells, secreting high amounts of PDGF activate adjuvant fibroblasts through a paracrine mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. As of now the exact mechanisms that regulate fibroblast activation and their role in the initiation and progression of diseases such as fibrosis and cancer are not fully understood. Anyway, fibroblasts might be a potent target for therapeutic intervention. As such, the transcriptomic invasion signature of fibroblasts presented in our study describes the invading phenotype to unprecedented detail and provides a powerful repository for future studies on fibroblast invasiveness and the feasibility of defining therapeutic strategies in targeting activated fibroblasts. In particular, secreted proteins such as MMP13 or Sfrp1, may represent promising therapeutic targets in pathologies exhibiting fibroblast invasion. By systematically analysing the interactome of the components identified herein, we will be able to further refine the mechanistic processes involved in fibroblast activation and invasion.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>For immunoblotting the following primary (1) and secondary antibodies (2) were used: (1) caveolin 1 (anti-cav1 (D46G3) XP, mono-clonal, rabbit, Cell Signalling (Danvers, MA, USA), 1:1,000), EGFR (anti-EGFR (D38B1), mono-clonal, rabbit, Cell Signalling, 1:1,000), FGFRI (anti-FGFRI (Ab-154), poly-clonal, rabbit, Sigma, 1:200), FGFRII (anti-FGFRII (CD332), poly-clonal, rabbit, Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA), 1:1,000), PDGFR&#x003b1; (anti- PDGFR&#x003b1; (C-20), poly-clonal, rabbit, Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX, USA), 1:500), PDGFR&#x003b2; (anti- PDGFR&#x003b2; (958), poly-clonal, rabbit, Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), Pten (138G6), mono-clonal, rabbit, Cell Signalling, 1:1,000), Sfrp1 (anti-Sfrp1(EPR7003), mono-clonal, rabbit, Abcam (Cambridge, UK), 1:1,000), TGF&#x003b2;1 (anti-TGF&#x003b2;1 (ab9758), Abcam, poly-clonal, rabbit, 1:200), TGF&#x003b2;RI (anti- TGF&#x003b2;RI (H-100), poly-clonal, rabbit, Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), TGF&#x003b2;RII (anti- TGF&#x003b2;RII (D-2), mono-clonal, mouse, Santa Cruz, 1:1,000) and monoclonal mouse anti-&#x003b2;-Actin-Peroxidase (AC-15, Sigma, 1:10,000); (2) goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signalling, 1:10,000) as secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Mouse lung fibroblasts, MLg (MLg 2908) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) (CCL-206) and cultivated in DMEM/HAM&#x02019;s F12 (catalog# E15-813, PAA (Pasching, Austria)) medium containing 10% FBS (PAA).
