During embryogenesis they act as morphogens and play a critical role during organ development. They influence cell fates via concentration-gradients in the embryos where cells transduce this extracellular information into gene expression profiles and cell fate decisions. How receiving cells decode and quantify BMP2/4 signals is hardly understood. There is little data on the quantitative relationships between signal input, transducing molecules, their states and location, and ultimately their ability to integrate graded systemic inputs and generate qualitative responses. Understanding this signaling network on a quantitative level should be considered a prerequisite for efficient pathway modulation, as the BMP pathway is a prime target for therapeutic invention. Hence, we quantified the spatial distribution of the main signal transducer of the BMP2/4 pathway in response to different types and levels of stimuli in c2c12 cells. We found that the subcellular localization of Smad1 is independent of ligand concentration. In contrast, Smad1 phosphorylation levels relate proportionally to BMP2 ligand concentrations and they are entirely located in the nucleus. Interestingly, we found that BMP2 stimulates target gene expression in non-linear, wave-like forms. Amplitudes showed a clear concentration-dependency, for sustained and transient stimulation. We found that even burst-stimulation triggers gene-expression wave-like modulations that are detectable for at least 30 h. Finally, we show here that target gene expression oscillations depend on receptor kinase activity, as the kinase drives further expression pulses without receptor reactivation and the target gene expression breaks off after inhibitor treatment in c2c12 cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de">www.dfg.de</ext-link>), and GK 1048 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gk-1048.uni-wuerzburg.de">www.gk-1048.uni-wuerzburg.de</ext-link>).

This is best illustrated by embryonic development. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) act as graded morphogens and are responsible for the dorsal-to-ventral cell type specification in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Ferguson1">[1]</xref>. Clearly, there must exist a machinery that translates these morphogen gradients into so far unknown cell fate mechanisms by thresholding them.</p><p>BMPs are secreted proteins that belong to the TGF-&#x000df; superfamily. They are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, adhesion as well as apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Patterson1">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Massagu1">[4]</xref>. The ligands signal through a family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Signaling occurs through the heterotetramerization of two receptor subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Massagu2">[5]</xref>. The constitutively active type II receptor activates the type I receptor by trans-phosphorylation, and the activated type I receptor then in turn activates the key signal transducers, the Smad proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Shi1">[6]</xref>. Distinct Smad family members have been identified and classified into three different subgroups. The receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) include Smad1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. They become phosphorylated by the type I receptor kinases. Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-&#x000df; proteins, while Smad1, 5 and 8 are activated by BMP ligands. The R-Smads form complexes with Smad4, which is the only member of the common mediator Smads (Co-Smads) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. The Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus and activate expression of target genes in association with other transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Feng1">[8]</xref>. However, even without ligand the cellular distribution of Smad2 and Smad3 is not static, but the proteins are constantly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Schmierer1">[9]</xref>. In the case of BMP signaling, Smad-complexes bind to short GC-rich DNA regions in target gene promoters that were identified as BMP-responsive elements (BRE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Korchynskyi1">[10]</xref>. The inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad6 and Smad7, stably bind to the intracellular domain of the type I receptor and thereby prevent the phosphorylation of R-Smads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Imamura1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Inoue1">[12]</xref>. Smad6 also exhibits other inhibitory functions like competing with Smad4 for binding to phosphorylated Smad1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Hata1">[13]</xref> and interacting with transcriptional co-repressors in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Murakami1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The BMP signaling pathway is implicated in severe human diseases like cancer, fibrosis, multiple hereditary conditions and wound-healing disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Gautschi1">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Connor1">[18]</xref>. This elucidates that its regulation needs to be tightly controlled and is often subject to disregulation. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect a strict fine tuning of each individual step of signal transduction when looking at the large number of modulatory factors that regulate the pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Sieber1">[19]</xref>). In order to successfully develop new therapeutics, it is thus pivotal to quantify the BMP signal transduction dynamics, their modulation and coupled transcriptional outcomes with high resolution and accuracy over an extended period of time. In this context a large number of studies have been published on the TGF&#x000df;-Smad2/3 pathway. First, indirect immunostaining had shown that Smad2 and Smad3 almost completely translocate into the nucleus after 30 minutes of stimulation with TGF-&#x000df; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Inman1">[20]</xref>. Later, the kinetics of the Smad2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling have been investigated with and without stimulation using GFP-fusions. It revealed, that the nuclear export rate for non-induced cells is more rapid than the import rate and that the nuclear accumulation of Smad2 upon stimulation is caused by a pronounced drop in the export rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Schmierer1">[9]</xref>. Recently, a study on quantification of TGF-&#x000df; signaling showed that both dose as well as time course of stimulation have significant effects on Smad2 signaling dynamics. Interestingly, this study also demonstrated that cells do respond to short time stimulation pulses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Zi1">[21]</xref>.</p><p>In principle, there are several ways to modulate signaling output. Besides ligand concentration, stimulation time obviously is an important signal modulator. Studies on ERK revealed that duration of its activation controls cell fate by proliferative or anti-proliferative responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Santos1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Marshall1">[23]</xref>. Similar results were obtained for the TGF&#x000df;-Smad2/3 pathway, where variation in the cellular behavior was evoked by different signaling durations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Nicols1">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Investigating the quantitative integration of BMP signaling, we present long-term measurements of cellular responses to both sustained and transient BMP2 stimulation under varying concentrations in c2c12 cells. Spatio-temporal analyses of Smad1 distribution revealed a basal shuttling mechanism that is unaffected by ligand stimulation. Moreover, the transcriptional responses were evaluated by two independent approaches. The gene expression induced by BMP results in oscillating curve patterns over time. Mathematical Fourier analysis of our measurements revealed two oscillation components that clearly responded to modulation of stimulation parameters and also verified that basal oscillation is fully dependent on receptor kinase activity in c2c12 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Smad1 shuttles constantly between nucleus and cytoplasm while the amount of pSmad increases in relation to the stimulation concentration</title><p>In order to measure the subcellular localization of Smad1 under non-stimulated and stimulated conditions, we performed indirect immunofluorescence staining using anti-Smad1 in c2c12 cells. For quantification of Smad1 amounts in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, respectively, we further stained cell membranes and nuclei with specific dyes. Confocal analysis revealed, that there is no significant difference in Smad1 subcellular localization upon ligand stimulation with 0.1 nM or 1 nM BMP2 over 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059442-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Cells were transiently cotransfected with the Smad1-GFP fusion construct and a H2B-mCherry vector and starved over night. On the next day, cells were stimulated with either 0 nM BMP2 or 1 nM BMP alone or while adding Leptomycin B and imaged at the indicated time points after stimulation using a confocal microscope.

Transfected cells were either non-stimulated or stimulated with 1 nM BMP2, but again did not find nuclear accumulation of the GFP-Smad1 fusion protein in either treatment up to 1 h after stimulation start. To ensure that the fusion protein was able to visualize nuclear accumulation of Smad1, we added the nuclear-export-inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) to the previously treated cells. Under this condition, GFP-Smad1 fusion proteins clearly accumulated in the nuclei of LMB treated cells independent of previous BMP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059442-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The quite different cell morphology is typical for this cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These findings indicate that Smad1 shuttles constantly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the distribution of Smad1 protein due to this basal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is not significantly altered by stimulation with either 0.1 nM or 1 nM BMP2. However, we found that the amount of nuclear phospho-Smad1 increases in a BMP2 stimulation time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s003">Figure S3A&#x02013;D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sustained and oscillating gene expression upon continuous stimulation with BMP2</title><p>We next investigated the time course of target gene expression of cells continuously stimulated with BMP2. We therefore generated a clonal cell line stably expressing the secreted Gaussia Luciferase under control of a BRE minimal promoter. Using secreted Luciferase allowed us to record a true time course of BMP induced promoter transcriptional regulation, as only a small volume of supernatant was taken from each cell culture well at each time point. We analyzed Luciferase activity over a time course of 4 h before to 30 h after stimulation. Total Luciferase activity was concentration dependent, which is clear evidence for a functional read-out system as well as the lag-phase at the beginning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Furthermore, as expected, Luciferase activity decreased to baseline levels when incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s006">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Ruecker1">[25]</xref>). We found that BMP-induced reporter gene expression is concentration- and time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059442-g002">figure 2A</xref>), and oscillating progressions suggest gene expression pulses during continuous stimulation with BMP2. Interestingly, the frequencies of the activity bursts are similar for all tested ligand concentrations, however, the wave-peak amplitudes show clear positive correlation with the respective BMP2-concentration used for stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059442-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s008">Figure S8A and B</xref>).

At later time points, the mRNA expression pulses decreased gradually to a low level of oscillations that were detectable until 30 h after stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s012">Figure S12</xref>). We could show that these transcript level oscillations do directly reflect changes of the target gene mRNA levels, but not changes of the housekeeping gene levels used for RNA level calibrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059442.s013">Figure S13A and B</xref>).</p><p>However, the results from these experiments differ in the oscillatory pattern as the Luciferase activity increases over time whereas the mRNA levels decrease. This could be attributed to many reasons including different translation dynamics, different promoters (optimized BRE-promoter element in contrast to endogenous promoters), measurement of protein activity in contrast to mRNA level, half-life times of mRNAs and proteins as well as the delay of the protein due to export, synthesis and folding.

A great deal of work has been done on modeling a series of different signaling pathways including the TGF-&#x000df; signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Zi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Clarke1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Batchelor1">[28]</xref>. Since BMP and TGF-&#x000df; signaling share the co-Smad, the inhibitory Smads as well as one receptor subtype, one could assume that the models of the TGF-&#x000df; pathway are conferrable to the BMP-pathway. In this study we examined the dynamics of the BMP signaling pathway and could show profound differences to the TGF-&#x000df; signaling dynamics.</p><p>For the TFG&#x000df;-Smad2/3 pathway, it is well known that Smad2/3 strongly accumulate in the nucleus upon stimulation with very low TGF-&#x000df; concentrations in the picomolar range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Inman1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Xu1">[29]</xref>. Our data indicate that this cannot be attributed to Smad1 in c2c12 cells. Instead we found that only the phospho-Smad1 level in the nuclei increases in proportion to the ligand-concentration. A similar effect has been described for Smad1 in a B-cell lymphoma cell line after stimulation with TGF-&#x000df; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Munoz1">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos also suggest that the pathway activity has little effect on the localization of Smad1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Warmflash1">[31]</xref>. Reasons for this difference within the Smad family are unknown, yet two studies indicate that differences in nuclear export signals might play a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Xiao1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Kurisaki1">[33]</xref>. Our results strongly suggest a constant, basal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad1, which is not significantly modulated by stimulation up to 1 nM BMP2. However, it has been shown that stimulation with 10 nM BMP2 leads to a clear nuclear accumulation of Smad1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Schwappacher1">[34]</xref>. As a conclusion, Smad1-shuttling dynamics are dose-dependent with a threshold-concentration in the range between 1 nM and 10 nM. The Smad1 import-rate exceeds the export-rate and the proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Reasons for that might be lacking dephosphorylation, more phospho-Smad1 proteins per complex meaning longer resting time on DNA or that export-proteins have poorer binding efficiency for phospho-Smad1 proteins; many possibilities for this phenomenon, but the real cause remains unexplored.</p><p>Concerning the TGF-&#x000df;/Smad pathway, it is known that upon sustained stimulation the amount of phospho-Smad2 increases to a maximum and then decreases to a constant level over 8 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Zi1">[21]</xref>. This fact points to a correlating gene expression profile. Our data also show a maximum of <italic>smad6</italic> expression after 2 h with subsequent relative peaks at two-hourly intervals. We conclude that there is a basal oscillation mechanism of the BMP-induced expression of <italic>id1</italic> and <italic>smad6.</italic> Oscillating target gene transcription is supported by the fact that <italic>hes1</italic> expression, which is controlled by BMP2 in embryonic stem cells, has been found to oscillate and a <italic>hes1</italic>-promoter driven Luciferase mimics this oscillatory expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Kobayashi1">[35]</xref>. We further conclude that the oscillatory frequency is not influenced by stimulation intensity (BMP concentration). Instead, the amplitudes are clearly dose-dependent. The discriminated signaling response in the case of Dorsomorphin treatment might be attributed to the input strength in combination with the inhibitor potency. Shortly after continuous stimulation with 1 nM BMP2 nuclear phospho-Smad1 level is considerably higher than the level with 0.1 nM. Thus after stimulation with BMP2 and subsequent kinase-inhibitor treatment, the phospho-Smad1 level is sufficient to exclusively trigger expression of very early target genes. Since phospho-Smad1 proteins are rapidly degraded by E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Fuentealba1">[36]</xref> expression of later target genes expires. Mouse models for lung cancer associate elevated BMP2 levels with increased malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Jiang1">[37]</xref>, promoted lung tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Langenfeld1">[38]</xref> and stimulated angiogenesis in developing tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Langenfeld2">[39]</xref>. Our study shows, that the BMP target gene transcription is dose-dependent. As BMP2 has been found to induce cell cycle regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Peiffer1">[40]</xref>, this might be a reason for pathological proliferation. Consequently, disease conditions might trigger Smad1 accumulation and thus break physiological regulatory pathway mechanisms.</p><p>Comparison of continuous exposure with kinase-inhibitory and wash-away treatment demonstrated that target gene oscillation is directly dependent on the receptor kinase. Furthermore, once ligand-bound, thus activated, receptor complexes keep up target-gene stimulation for at least 8 h and in wave-like forms without receptor reactivation. It is known that Smad6 is an inhibitor of BMP signaling and continuous expression of Smad6 leads to the inhibition of phospho-Smad1 formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Yoshiura1">[41]</xref>. As our results show that <italic>smad6</italic> oscillates with 1 h delay to <italic>id1</italic>, Smad6 is a negative feedback regulator and may be an important regulator for the wave-like response. Possible advantages of oscillating responses are minimized exposure to high levels of ligand. Furthermore, transforming stimuli into oscillatory signals is more robust against noise in the input signal and signal propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059442-Rapp1">[42]</xref>. However, the real causes for these oscillations remain unclear.</p><p>During embryogenesis, body patterning and axis formation are determined by morphogen gradients and different cell fates result from distinct gene expression profiles. Furthermore, BMPs are used as therapeutics in the clinic. Our data on signal half-life, the influence of BMP2 concentration, exposure time and receptor inhibition on the temporal course of target-gene-expression create a basis for a novel mathematical model for the BMP signaling pathway that could be used to improve drug compositions, amounts and administration for the compensation of developmental defects and the patients benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The mouse myoblast cell line c2c12 (purchased from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lgcstandards-atcc.org/">http://lgcstandards-atcc.org/</ext-link>.
