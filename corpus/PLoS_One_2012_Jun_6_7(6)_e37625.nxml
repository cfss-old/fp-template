It is cause for widespread alarm as it is currently an emerging disease with a high incidence in tropical countries and thus considered to be a major global veterinary and human health problem. Direct or indirect contact with <italic>Leptospira</italic>, via a contaminated environment, especially water polluted with urine from infected animals, or via infected animals, causes an infection characterized from mild symptoms (anicteric form) to severe infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Faine1">[1]</xref>. The Weil&#x02019;s syndrome, the most severe form of leptospirosis, is a classical model of sepsis that includes acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Poh1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-DeBrito1">[3]</xref>. A great number of possible virulent factors such as hemolysin, flagellin, heat shock protein, outer membrane proteins (OMPs), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glycolipoproteins (GLP) and others have been thought to be accountable for the infection, but to date, their effective role in leptospirosis pathogenesis is still unclear.</p><p>The renal injury observed in leptospirosis frequently produces a polyuric form of acute renal injury, followed by hypokalemia with an elevated urinary fractional excretion of potassium and an inability to concentrate urine. This increased kaliuresis is due to a decrease of potassium reabsorption in the damaged proximal tubule and to an increase of its secretion in the distal tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Andrade1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Seguro1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Sitprija1">[6,]</xref>. The concentrating defect is due, at least in part, to a decrease in the water permeability in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) probably produced by a bacterial endotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Magaldi1">[7]</xref>.

The increase of the urinary volume and the decrease of the urinary osmolality are a consequence of the urinary concentration defect. This concentration defect was explained by the very low water permeability in the infected guinea pigs in comparison with the normal animals. These data are in accordance with those found in leptospirotic patients with acute renal injury.</p><p>In Group II, experiments were carried out in order to investigate if GLP could be one of the toxins responsible by this defect. The direct effect of GLPc on IMCDs from normal guinea pigs was studied. In the first GLPc experiment, when this endotoxin was applied to the bath after vasopressin, the hormone effect dropped about 30&#x00025;, but when GLPc was applied before, it blocked the hormone effect completely. These results could be interpreted as evidence that the GLPc is acting on the Vp cascade and these different data between the two experiments could also be interpreted as evidence that the GLPc is competing with the Vp for the Vp receptor. Although this is an attractive hypothesis, binding experiments would have to be carried out to prove it.</p><p>In order to study at which point of the vasopressin cascade this cytotoxin is acting, initially the GLPc effect on the action of cAMP was analyzed. GLPc did not block cAMP, indicating that it acted before cAMP synthesis. To verify the GLPc effect on adenylyl cyclase, forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase stimulator, was used. The results demonstrated that GLPc did not decrease the forskolin effect, indicating that in this step of the vasopressin cascade, GLPc is not acting either. To study the GLPc effect on protein G (guanine nucleotide-binding protein), cholera toxin was used (a stimulator of the protein-G system). Its effect was partially inhibited (about 15&#x00025;) by GLPc, demonstrating that the L<italic>eptospira</italic> endotoxin is acting on the protein-G system. A GLP extracted from a non-pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> (<italic>Leptospira biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc strain Patoc I, extracted by the same procedure for extracting the pathogenic GLP), was used as a control of the pathologenic GLP. The results demonstrated that this GLPp was not able to block the effect of vasopressin, showing that the substances used in the GLP extraction did not interfere in its action (see MM).</p><p>The substantial reduction of the Pf, observed in infected guinea pigs, could be undoubtedly caused not only by the GLP effect but also by the effects of the large quantity of other toxins and inflammation mediators released into the blood stream due to the severe systemic infection. In the microperfusion experiments in the second Group the conditions were substantially different, where the amount of GLPc used was, certainly, much lower than that in the blood stream in the infected animals. Even so, the Pf was decreased, showing its effect evidencing that the GLP is acting on the Vp-Protein G complex.</p><p>In order to study the effect of GLPc on the expression of Aquaporin 2, a third group was included. The procedure chosen was to inoculate GLPc by the intraperitoneal route in normal guinea pigs, the same procedure used to infect the other animals. This experiment showed that the AQP2 expression decreased about 20&#x00025;, indicating that GLP could also act when applied into the peritoneal cavity. Although 20&#x00025; is a small decrease in comparison to the infected animals, this amount is enough to promote an increase in the urinary volume.</p><p>Renal involvement in leptospirosis is well documented, but the effect of GLP on renal function is rarely reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-DeBrito1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Sitprija1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Magaldi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Santos1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-DeBrito2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Marshall1">[23]</xref>.

Pereira et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Pereira1">[24]</xref> showed that leptospiral antigens (GLP) bind and cause damage to the proximal and distal segments of the nephron. These lesions on proximal and distal tubules can explain the natriuresis, hypokalemia, kaliuresis and the concentrating defect, as was reported by Seguro et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Seguro1">[5]</xref> in patients and demonstrated by Magaldi et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Magaldi1">[7]</xref> in experimental studies.</p><p>The polyuria observed in leptospirosis could be explained by at least two mechanisms: 1- Proximal tubule injury - it is well known that animals with leptospirostic renal insufficiency present focal interstitial nephrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-DeBrito1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Arean1">[25]</xref> and an impairment in the concentrating process, accompanied by natriuresis, kaliuresis and hypokalemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Seguro1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Magaldi1">[7]</xref>, whose origins were recently and elegantly demonstrated by Andrade et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Andrade1">[4]</xref> and Araujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Araujo1">[26,]</xref>. In these last studies, a decrease in the NHE3 protein abundance was demonstrated. This decrease in the NHE3 function promotes low sodium reabsorption and, consequently, low water reabsorption thus increasing the delivery of sodium and water to the distal nephron, which in turn causes natriuresis and contributes to the increase in urinary volume. 2- Decreased vasopressin responsiveness in IMCD - this fact is accountable for the decrease in AQP2 expression in IMCDs, shown in the present study in guinea pigs inoculated with GLP and also demonstrated by Andrade et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Andrade1">[4]</xref> in infected hamsters. This occurrence can explain the decrease in water absorption in this segment, resulting in an inability to concentrate urine and an increase in urinary volume. Another possibility could be considered taking into account studies showing the inhibitory effect on Na,K ATPase by GLP and on Na, K, Cl co-transporter NKCC2 by an outer membrane protein, which could contribute to a decrease in the formation of the medullary hypertonicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-YounesIbrahim1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Wu1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, it is well known that hypocalemia can cause a decrease in the Vp action leading to a decrease in water absorption. However, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments the potassium levels remained constant during the perfusion.</p><p>The recovery of the renal function after AKI is quickly, but in some cases a urinary concentration incapacity remains for more than six months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Daher1">[29]</xref>.These findings could reveal that the tubular injuries in the AKI were very severe and did not have good recovery.</p><p>On the other hand, in direct opposition to our data, Araujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037625-Araujo1">[26]</xref> using immunohistochemistry, detected an increase instead of a decrease in AQP2 expression in collecting tubules from both patients with acute kidney injury caused by leptospirosis and by acute tubular necrosis caused by other pathologies. This finding was interpreted by the authors as a compensatory response to retain the excess of water delivery to the distal nephrons in a renal recovery phase of the disease, since in these two pathologies,the proximal tubules were damaged. However, these data were obtained from autopsies and depended on the severity and on the stage of the disease at the time of patients&#x02019; death, while our data were obtained from infected animals whose sacrifice was programmed and in an initial phase of the disease.</p><p>Taken as a whole, our data showed that GLPc applied on isolated IMCDs from normal guinea pigs, could reproduce the results found in experiments with guinea pigs infected with the spirochaetes providing evidences that this endotoxin is an important contributor to the virulence of the <italic>Leptospira</italic>.</p><p>Finally, the urinary concentration defect observed in patients with leptospirosis can be explained, at least in part, by the decrease of vasopressin responsiveness, which induces a decrease in water absorption in the last nephron segment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Parts of this study have already been presented at the ERA-EDTA Congress 2009.
