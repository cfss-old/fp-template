(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a primary pest of apples throughout the United States. Reliance on broad spectrum organophosphates has been declining with the slated cancellation and has shifted towards narrow spectrum insecticides. Novaluron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor, has primarily been used for its ovicidal and larvacidal activities. However, recent studies have demonstrated a transovarial effect after exposure to adults. The effects of novaluron were studied to determine if reduced egg hatch occurs after exposure of different sexes to this compound. Effects of this compound through horizontal transfer were also compared with a topical application to <italic>C. pomonella</italic> eggs. Results from independent exposure of different sexes to novaluron were different than the control for all three exposure types; male only, female only, and both treated. The horizontal transfer experiment yielded no significant difference while the topical application of novaluron on eggs showed significantly lower egg hatch. Although novaluron has no direct toxicity to adults, the results of this study demonstrate that the delayed lethal activity of this compound reduces hatching of eggs laid by treated adults. Along with the direct ovicidal and larvicidal properties of novaluron, the delayed lethal activity provides an important contribution to the overall control seen in the field.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chitin synthesis inhibitor</kwd><kwd>horizontal transfer</kwd><kwd>transovarial transfer</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The codling moth, <italic>Cydia pomonella</italic> (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is one of the most significant pests of temperate pome fruits worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18">Hoyt et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr04">Barnes 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">Howitt 1993</xref>). Historically, <italic>C. pomonella</italic> management tactics have ranged from broad-spectrum insecticides to pheromone-mediated mating disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr03">Barnes and Moffitt 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr07">Croft and Hoyt 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15">Howell and Maitlen 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31">Riedl et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr06">Brunner et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42">Wise et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43">Witzgall et al. 2008</xref>). However, due to regulatory changes in the United States under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 (Public Law 104&#x02013;170), registration of many organophosphate and carbamate insecticides have been mitigated, canceled or otherwise altered. With the US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency)-mandated phase-out of azinphosmethyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37">US EPA 2006</xref>) slated for 2012, many new insecticide chemicals have been introduced into USA tree fruit production programs to replace this management tool. However, the FQPA has not been the only incentive to alter older insecticide use patterns in orchards; resistance has also driven the search for replacements in the use against <italic>C. pomonella</italic> and other leafroller species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38">Varela et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21">Knight et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10">Dunley and Welter 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30">Reuveny and Cohen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25">Mota-Sanchez et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39">Whalon et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>In response to the FQPA, the EPA has established classifications for two new groups: 1) reduced risk and 2) organophosphate-replacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36">US EPA 1997</xref>). The EPA defines reduced risk insecticides as those that exhibit lower environmental impact and reduced toxicity to humans, mammals and other wildlife, while reducing the risk of groundwater contamination and presumably resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37">US EPA 2006</xref>). Of these newer reduced risk and organophosphate-alternative chemicals, the insect growth regulators have demonstrated promise within integrated pest management programs by providing more sustainable attributes, which were outlined by a report issued in 2004 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35">USDA 2004</xref>). Insect growth regulators can be readily implemented into integrated pest management programs due to their reduced potential for environmental and ecological impacts, and thus have played a substantial role in integrated pest management of pome fruits in the United States over the last decade. These compounds are represented by several classes of chemicals that alter the growth and development of the targeted pest.</p><p>Benzoylurea insecticides are chitin synthesis inhibitors that are insect growth regulators (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee, Group 15), (IRAC 2010). These compounds interfere with cuticle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26">Mulder and Gijswijt 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20">Ishaaya and Casida 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29">Post et al. 1974</xref>), although the exact step in which inhibition occurs remains unclear. Several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of chitin may take place at the polymerization stage of chitin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14">Hajjar and Casida 1978</xref>) or in chitin precursor transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">Nakagawa and Matsumura 1994</xref>). Among the variety of benzoylurea compounds, diflubenzuron was one of the first marketed and has been well studied as a chitin synthesis inhibitor. This insecticide has strong larvicidal and ovicidal activity on the target pest, but also demonstrates sublethal activity on <italic>C. pomonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17">Hoying and Riedl 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11">Elliot and Anderson 1982</xref>). The term sublethal generally refers to cases in which there are no lethal effects on the life-stage that is in direct contact with the pesticide, but population effects are seen in the subsequent generation as a result of reduced fecundity or egg/larval viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42">Wise and Whalon 2009</xref>). Depending on the mechanism responsible, these effects may be more accurately called delayed lethal effects.</p><p>A new benzoylurea compound, novaluron, was recently developed for use in apple production. Like diflubenzuron, the direct lethal effects of novaluron as an ovicide and larvicide have been the primary basis for its use in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pomonella</italic> management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr06">Brunner et al 2005</xref>). Recent studies examining the delayed lethal effects of novaluron on <italic>C. pomonella</italic> have demonstrated reduced egg hatch after adult exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e et al. 2009</xref>). However, the contribution of adult male versus female exposure was not determined. Similar delayed lethal effects of novaluron have been seen in other key pests, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Transovarial movement of the compound from the exposed adult to their eggs and larvae is one mechanism that has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr08">Cutler et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22">Kostyukosky and Trostanetsky 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40">Wise et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr01">Alyokhin et al. 2008</xref>). A second suggested explanation for novaluron's activity is the horizontal transfer from contaminated tarsi or scales of previously exposed adults to unexposed eggs, which has been documented with another insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) against mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr09">Chism and Apperson 2003</xref>).</p><p>The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the contribution of adult male versus female exposure to novaluron's delayed lethal effects on hatching of <italic>C. pomonella</italic> eggs and 2) determine if adult mediated horizontal transfer contributes to the effects of novaluron on hatching of eggs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2a"><title>Insect material</title><p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>pomonella</italic> pupae were obtained from the Yakima Agricultural Research Laboratory, Wapato, Washington, where the larvae were reared on artificial wheat germ based diet and conditioned in constant light for 24 &#x02013; 48 hours at 21&#x000b0; C and 60% RH.

A possible explanation for this is that under male-only exposure novaluron may be transferred to the female during copulation. Moore et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">1978</xref>) demonstrated that the chitin synthesis inhibitor, diflubenzuron, was transferred between sexes in boll weevils and resulted in reduced hatching of eggs laid after treated males were allowed to mate with untreated females.</p><p>Novaluron does not appear to affect <italic>C. pomonella</italic> fecundity, regardless of whether males or females are exposed, confirming the results of previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e et al. 2009</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that exposure to novaluron does not negatively impact the fecundity of female <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr01">Alyokin et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr02">2009</xref>) or <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22">Kostyukovsky and Trostanetsky 2006</xref>).</p><p>The lack of significant reduction in egg hatching in the horizontal transfer experiment suggests that transfer of novaluron by contaminated females onto previously laid eggs is not a valid explanation for the delayed lethal effects previously claimed for this compound. However, other exposure methods such as direct/topical contact should be explored before ruling out horizontal transfer. The results from the topical application confirm what has already been published on the direct ovicidal effects of novaluron on <italic>C. pomonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr06">Brunner et al. 2005</xref>). The results presented in this study and by G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">2009</xref>), demonstrate that the observed reduction in egg hatch is likely related to the transfer of the compound within the female, as opposed to superficial contact of exposed females to eggs.</p><p>The exact mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the observed delayed lethal effects is yet to be determined. There is evidence for a physiological mechanism whereby exposure to diflubenzuron resulted in compromised reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33">Soltani and Soltani-Mazouni 1992</xref>). Transovarial transfer to eggs as a mechanism has gained evidence from several researchers using diflubenzuron or novaluron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12">Elek 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23">Medina et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22">Kostyukovsky and Trostanetsky 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34">Trostanetsky and Kostyukosky 2008</xref>). Medina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23">2002</xref>) demonstrated presence of benzylurea in the ovaries and eggs of <italic>Chysoperla carnea</italic> using radio-labeled diflubenzuron after adults were exposed to the compound. Numerous observations were made in our study of eggs in the novaluron treatments that failed to eclose while in the black-head stage, which provides further support for the transovarial mechanism of activity. If the mechanism is transovarial in nature then research is still needed to determine the morphological pathway the compound takes from the adult moth to the eggs. Research conducted by Alyokin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr02">2009</xref>) showed that Colorado potato beetles treated continuously with novaluron-treated foliage resulted in failure of egg hatch, but egg hatch was restored after several days exposure to untreated foliage.</p><p>In pome fruit integrated pest management programs, novaluron use is primarily based on its ovicidal and larvacidal properties throughout the growing season. However, the contribution of novaluron's delayed lethal activity needs to be considered when applying field treatments. With the imminent phase-out of azinphosmethyl, the newer classes of insecticides being marketed must be well understood and their patterns of use optimized. Incorporation of novaluron into <italic>C. pomonella</italic> mating disruption programs may result in enhanced seasonal control of this key pest. Although mating disruption has been
successful in low populations, the migration of mated females into mating disruption areas and areas with high populations require chemical applications to prevent fruit damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr05">Brunner et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43">Witzgall et al. 2008</xref>). The addition of the lethal and delayed lethal effects of novaluron can complement the adult effects of mating disruption in an integrated pest management system.</p><p>More research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms responsible for its effects on reduced hatching of eggs seen in this study and in G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">2009</xref>). Future research is needed to determine how transovarial novaluron affects egg hatch, and if reduced egg hatch is measureable under field conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Pete Nelson and Josh Iamurri for their assistance in the completion of these experiments.
