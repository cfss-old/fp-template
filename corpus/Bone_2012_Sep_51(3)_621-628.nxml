Binding of circulating FGF23 to FGF receptors in the cell membrane requires the concurrent presence of the co-receptor &#x003b1;Klotho. It is still controversial whether &#x003b1;Klotho is expressed in the kidney proximal tubule, the principal site of phosphate reabsorption. Hence, it has remained an enigma as to how FGF23 downregulates renal phosphate reabsorption. Here, we show that renal proximal tubular cells do express the co-receptor &#x003b1;Klotho together with cognate FGF receptors, and that FGF23 directly downregulates membrane expression of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a by serine phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange regulatory cofactor (NHERF)-1 through ERK1/2 and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fibroblast growth factor-23</kwd><kwd>Klotho</kwd><kwd>Phosphate homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Kidney</kwd><kwd>Mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>Edited by: R.

FGF23 is secreted by osteocytes and osteoblasts in bone in response to elevated phosphate and vitamin D, and acts mainly on the kidney to down-regulate renal tubular phosphate reuptake and 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase expression as part of a negative feedback loop between bone and kidney <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The down-regulation of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase expression suppresses production of the biologically active vitamin D hormone, 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Although the renal effects of FGF23 are well characterized at the whole organ level, the molecular mechanism underlying the phosphaturic action of FGF23 has remained elusive.</p><p>Cellular signaling of FGF23 requires the concurrent presence of FGF receptors (FGFRs) and the transmembrane protein &#x003b1;Klotho, which functions as a co-receptor <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. While FGFRs are ubiquitously expressed, &#x003b1;Klotho expression is restricted to few tissues and hence targets the endocrine actions of circulating FGF23 to specific tissues. In the kidney, Klotho is expressed mainly in the distal tubule <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but the major site of regulation of phosphate excretion is the proximal tubule. Although earlier <italic>in vitro</italic> microperfusion experiments with isolated rabbit proximal tubules suggested a possible direct effect of FGF23 on the proximal tubule <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the current dogma is that FGF23 acts on the distal tubule, generating an unknown endocrine or paracrine secondary signal that in turn signals back to the proximal tubule to lower apical membrane expression of the sodium-phosphate cotransporters type 2a (NaPi-2a) and 2c (NaPi-2c) <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> that primarily mediate renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. A recent study, however, suggested that &#x003b1;Klotho may be expressed at low levels also in the proximal tubule, and that &#x003b1;Klotho may itself be a phosphaturic hormone <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The extracellular domain of &#x003b1;Klotho can be shed from the cell surface and released into the blood circulation, and it is thought that this secreted form of &#x003b1;Klotho may have the ability to alter the function and abundance of membrane glycoproteins such as NaPi-2a by removing sialic acid or other terminal sugars from sugar chains through a putative glycosidase activity <xref rid="bb0040 bb0045 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[8&#x02013;10]</xref>.</p><p>It was the aim of the current study to elucidate further the molecular mechanism underlying the phosphaturic action of FGF23. Here, we show that murine proximal tubular epithelium expresses &#x003b1;Klotho, and that FGF23 acts directly on proximal tubules to downregulate membrane expression of NaPi-2a via activation of ERK1/2 and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0025"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, and by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research.

To test this possibility <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected mice with rFGF23, and performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of the NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 complex on renal brush border membrane vesicle (BBMV) preparations. rFGF23 caused an almost 4-fold increase in urinary phosphate excretion compared to vehicle injection (46.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10.4 vs. 12.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.6&#x000a0;mmol/mmol creatinine in vehicle-treated controls, P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), and this effect was accompanied by hypophosphatemia (2.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.2 vs. 3.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.3&#x000a0;mmol/l in vehicle-treated controls, P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). The rFGF23-induced phosphaturia was associated with a 50% reduction in membrane abundance of the NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 complex (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A). Immunofluorescence staining of paraffin sections with anti-NHERF-1 and anti-phosphoserine antibodies showed a clear reduction in the apical membrane abundance of NHERF-1, and a general increase in serine phosphorylation in proximal tubular epithelium of rFGF23-treated mice (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B). Moreover, the co-staining also suggested increased serine phosphorylation of NHERF-1 in the apical membrane, 8&#x000a0;h after rFGF23 injection (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B).

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the phosphaturic action of FGF23 is still unknown. The current study has shown 1) that &#x003b1;Klotho is expressed at the mRNA and protein level in proximal tubules together with FGFR1, 3, and 4, 2) that FGF23 induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SGK1 in cultured proximal tubule cells, 3) that the FGF23-induced downregulation of NaPi-2a expression in renal proximal tubular segments is SGK1 dependent, 4) that FGF23 signaling leads to serine phosphorylation of NHERF-1 in proximal tubular segments, 5) that FGF23 reduces membrane abundance of the NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, and 6) that the presence of the co-receptor Klotho is essential for the FGF23-induced downregulation of NaPi-2a expression in renal proximal tubular segments at near physiological concentrations.</p><p>Our data are in very good agreement with the study by Weinman and coworkers <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The latter authors recently reported that FGF23 increases phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured proximal tubular cells. In addition, they showed that proximal tubular cells from NHERF-1 null mice are resistant to the inhibitory action of FGF23 on phosphate transport, and that proximal tubular cells from NHERF-1 null mice infected with a mutated form of the NHERF-1 protein which cannot be phosphorylated at serine-77 do not respond to FGF23 treatment. By using a different approach, our study provides direct evidence that FGF23 induces phosphorylation of NHERF-1 in isolated proximal tubular segments, which is probably the best <italic>in vitro</italic> model of proximal tubular physiology because the cells stay in their natural environment and do not lose polarity. In addition, we show that FGF23 downregulates membrane abundance of NHERF-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our finding that apical membrane abundance of NHERF-1 was profoundly reduced in mice 8&#x000a0;h after rFGF23 injection is in accordance with the known fact that PTH-induced phosphorylation of NHERF-1 leads to internalization and degradation of the NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 complex <xref rid="bb0105 bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. Taken together, our study and the study by Weinman et al. <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> provide compelling evidence that NHERF-1 is a downstream target of FGF23 signaling.</p><p>The current study suggests that FGF23 acts directly on proximal tubular epithelium through its canonical, &#x003b1;Klotho and FGFR dependent, signaling pathway. Moreover, we show for the first time that SGK1 is an essential component of the intracellular signaling cascade leading to the FGF23-induced downregulation of NaPi-2a membrane expression. It is currently unknown whether NHERF-1 is directly phosphorylated by activated SGK1. Since SGK1 can directly interact with NHERF family proteins in the distal tubule <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it is conceivable that NHERF-1 is directly phosphorylated by SGK1 also in proximal tubules.</p><p>It was previously thought that &#x003b1;Klotho is mainly expressed in the distal tubule <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Earlier immunohistochemical studies using a rat monoclonal anti-Klotho antibody on cryosections failed to detect &#x003b1;Klotho in proximal tubules of mice <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, Farrow and coworkers <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> showed in a time course study that the earliest changes in activation of ERK1/2 after injection of FGF23 <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice occur in the distal tubules. Therefore, the current dogma is that FGF23 acts on the distal tubule where it generates an unknown endocrine or paracrine secondary signal that in turn signals back to the proximal tubule to downregulate transcellular phosphate transport <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. Hu et al. <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> proposed an alternative hypothesis, namely that &#x003b1;Klotho itself may be a phosphaturic hormone by altering the glycosylation pattern of NaPi-2a integrated in the apical membrane through its putative enzymatic activity. The latter hypothesis requires the presence of &#x003b1;Klotho at the apical cell membrane where NaPi-2a is expressed. However, our study using a polyclonal rabbit antibody clearly showed that &#x003b1;Klotho is expressed in proximal tubular epithelium, but mainly at the basolateral membrane, suggesting that the major function of &#x003b1;Klotho may be its function as a co-receptor for blood-borne FGF23. The discrepant findings regarding &#x003b1;Klotho expression in the kidney in our compared with earlier studies <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> may be explained by differences in the anti-Klotho antibodies used. If the phosphaturic action of FGF23 is a direct effect on proximal tubules, how can it then be explained that the earliest signaling events after injection of FGF23 <italic>in vivo</italic> occur in distal tubules <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>? Unpublished data (Andrukhova et al.) from our laboratory have shown that FGF23 is also an important regulator of the TRPV5 epithelial calcium channel in distal tubules, suggesting that FGF23 may have parallel and independent effects in proximal and distal renal tubules. The FGF23-induced signaling events in distal renal tubules may occur faster than in proximal tubules, explaining the findings by Farrow et al. <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>A caveat of the current study is that we used a concentration of 100&#x000a0;ng/ml in most of our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Faul and coworkers <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> recently showed that FGF23 can signal in an &#x003b1;Klotho independent fashion at concentration of 10&#x000a0;ng/ml and higher. In agreement with the data of Faul et al. <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we also found some Klotho independent activity of 100&#x000a0;ng/ml rFGF23 to suppress NaPi-2a expression in proximal tubular segments <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, although our <italic>in vivo</italic> data fully confirm our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we cannot totally rule out the possibility of &#x003b1;Klotho independent effects induced by FGF23 signaling in most of our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. However, our experiments with proximal tubular segments isolated from <italic>Kl</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/VDR<sup>&#x02206;/&#x02206;</sup> mice clearly showed that lower, near physiological concentrations of FGF23 directly suppress NaPi-2a protein expression in proximal tubular epithelium in a Klotho dependent manner. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional experiments are necessary to confirm the FGF23-induced signaling pathways at physiological concentrations in renal proximal tubules.</p><p>We propose a model (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>) wherein FGF23 and PTH signaling converge at the NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 complex, providing a molecular explanation for the observed interaction between both signaling pathways in the regulation of proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Andrukhova et al., unpublished). Taken together, our data show that FGF23 directly acts on proximal tubular cells to down-regulate membrane abundance of NaPi-2a through the ERK1/2&#x02013;SGK1&#x02013;NHERF-1 signaling axis. Hence, our data uncover the long sought molecular mechanism of the phosphaturic action of FGF23. Improved knowledge of the cellular mechanisms involved in the phosphaturic action of FGF23 may open up new possibilities for therapeutic intervention in phosphate-wasting disorders and other diseases in which modulation of renal phosphate excretion is a therapeutic goal.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation
