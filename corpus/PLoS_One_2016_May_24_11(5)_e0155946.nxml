In this work, we focused on the efficacy and molecular mechanisms involved in the antitumoral effects of UA, as single agent or combined with doxorubicin (DXR), in human soft tissue sarcoma cells. UA (5&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M) strongly inhibited (up to 80%) the viability of STS cells at 24 h and its proliferation in soft agar, with higher concentrations increasing apoptotic death up to 30%. UA treatment (6&#x02013;9 h) strongly blocked the survival AKT/GSK3&#x003b2;/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling pathway, which led to a concomitant reduction of the anti-apoptotic proteins c-Myc and p21, altogether resulting in the activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Interestingly, UA at low concentrations (10&#x02013;15 &#x003bc;M) enhanced the antitumoral effects of DXR by up to 2-fold, while in parallel inhibiting DXR-induced AKT activation and p21 expression, two proteins implicated in antitumoral drug resistance and cell survival. In conclusion, UA is able to induce intrinsic apoptosis in human STS cells and also to sensitize these cells to DXR by blocking the AKT signalling pathway. Therefore, UA may have beneficial effects, if used as nutraceutical adjuvant during standard chemotherapy treatment of STS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research was supported by the Institute of Health Carlos III through the subprogramme &#x0201c;CIBERobn (Centro de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Biom&#x000e9;dica en Red de la Fisiopatolog&#x000ed;a de la Obesidad y Nutrici&#x000f3;n)&#x0201d;.

Of particular interest in this context have been various fruits, including olive fruits (<italic>Olea europaea</italic>), cranberries, apples, pears and prunes, and some medicinal herbs, such as lavender and salvia, all of them containing the natural pentacyclic triterpene ursolic acid (UA) [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This natural compound has received increasing attention in the last few years due to its antitumoral effect, exhibiting antiproliferative and apoptotic activities in a variety of human carcinoma cells [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in UA-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, such as inhibition of DNA replication [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], increase of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB activation [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as well as down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and survivin) and caspase activation [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, induction of cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], inhibition of angiogenesis and invasion of tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have also been attributed to UA. Interestingly, inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling pathway was recently found to be involved in some of its above described antitumoral effects [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The intracellular PI3K/AKT pathway is an important cell signalling route for growth factor-induced proliferation and survival of several cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Once activated by PI3K, AKT moves from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus, where it promotes cell cycle progression and prevents apoptosis in several ways, thereby controlling essential cellular regulator proteins (e.g., cyclin D, c-Myc or &#x003b2;-catenin) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (e.g., p21/WAF1). In this regard, cytosolic stabilization of p21 by its direct phosphorylation may be one of the mechanisms by which AKT contributes to prevent apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, AKT activation also inhibits GSK3&#x003b2; through phosphorylation, thereby blocking c-Myc and &#x003b2;-catenin degradation, which in turn facilitates tumor cell proliferation and invasion [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) constitute a heterogeneous group of malignant mesenchymal tumors, for which the standard chemotherapy, based on doxorubicin (DXR) alone or in combination with other drugs, does not achieve significant improvements in terms of overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, immunohistochemical studies found elevated phosphorylation of AKT and a concomitant up-regulation of downstream effectors (e.g., GSK3&#x003b2; and &#x003b2;-catenin) in tumors of patients with STS, especially in synovial sarcoma [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and leiomyosarcoma [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies evaluated the efficacy of UA in a variety of cell and animal models of adenocarcinoma (for a review see [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), only little is known regarding its effects in STS and whether a combination of this natural compound with conventional chemotherapy could improve treatment outcome for this type of solid tumors. Our study focused on the efficacy and molecular mechanisms involved in the antitumoral effects of UA, either as individual agent or in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic DXR in STS cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>The human synovial sarcoma SW982 (HTB-93<sup>&#x02122;</sup>), leiomyosarcoma SK-UT-1 (HTB-114<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 (CCL-121<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) cell lines were obtained directly from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cell lines were chosen because they show low sensitivity to doxorubicin (DXR) treatment [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which is a prerequisite for the aim of the study. SW982 and SK-UT-1 cells express the multidrug resistant-related protein 1 (MPR-1) at similar levels, but differ in the level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is barely expressed in SK-UT-1 cells. Synovial sarcoma cells were grown in Leibovitz&#x02019;s L-15 medium (Invitrogen S.A, Barcelona, Spain), whereas leiomyosarcoma SK-UT-1 and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (LabClinics S.A, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with MEM-non essential aminoacids (dilution 1:100) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Both media contained 2 mM L-glutamine and were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. Tissue culture supplements were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). When the cells reached 60&#x02013;70% confluence, vehicle (DMSO), triciribine phosphate (TCN), ursolic acid (UA) or DXR as single agents or their combinations were added to the medium for 6, 9, 12 and 24 h. UA and DXR were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Stock solutions of UA and TCN were prepared at a concentration of 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or in water in the case of DXR.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Cell viability</title><p>Synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma SK-UT-1 and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 11 x 10<sup>3</sup> or 8 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells per well in 200 &#x003bc;l of their respective growth medium, and cultured for 24 h. To test the effectiveness of UA on cell viability, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of UA (1&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h. The compound concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of cell viability (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined using GraphPad software. To determine whether UA or TCN would increase sensitivity of these cell lines to DXR, cells were treated with varying concentrations of DXR (range 0.1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M) with or without UA (10 or 15 &#x003bc;M) or TCN (30 &#x003bc;M). After 24 h, the viability of the cells was measured using the methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) method. The mean percentage of cell survival relative to that of vehicle-treated cells was estimated from data of three individual experiments each performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Soft agar colony assay</title><p>A base layer of 0.6% agarose (agarose D1 Low EEO, Conda, Pronadisa) in complete growth medium was plated in 6-well plates.

On the other hand, Bozzi et al. suggested that the overexpression of several tyrosine kinase receptors that signal through AKT contributes to the proliferation of these tumor cells through &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], since mutations in APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) or &#x003b2;-catenin, which would promote its nuclear accumulation, are rare in synovial sarcoma [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

This is an important finding because STS is a cancer with still few therapeutic options and modern drugs based on specific molecular targeting have not been introduced as standard treatment scheme of STS yet. After short-term treatments (6 or 9 h) with UA a strong AKT inhibition with concomitant GSK3&#x003b2; activation and reduced &#x003b2;-catenin levels could be detected in synovial SW982 sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In this context, TCN, an AKT inhibitor, which also decreased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3&#x003b2; at ser9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g004">Fig 4</xref>), diminished as well growth in both sarcoma cell lines similar to UA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The SK-UT-1 cells used in our study differ from SW982 cells as the former have mutations in the <italic>PI3KCA</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> genes (phosphatase and tensin homologe, deleted on chromosome 10; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines/sample/">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines/sample/</ext-link>), which should lead to a higher basal AKT activation. Probably as a consequence, UA was still able to induce a significant effect on cell viability, but with lower efficacy compared to the wild type cell line SW982 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Another difference between the cell lines is that UA completely blocked proliferation of SK-UT-1 cells in soft agar, confirming its antiproliferative and apoptotic effect, whereas this effect could not be evaluated in SW982 cells, since they did not grow under soft agar conditions, suggesting an anchorage-dependent proliferation for this sarcoma cell line. Others showed that inhibition of Tcf/&#x003b2;-catenin protein-protein interaction provoked down-regulation of various &#x003b2;-catenin targets, such as c-Myc, and suppressed cell viability in human synovial sarcoma cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These findings are in line with our results, which not only demonstrated a reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein c-Myc (a &#x003b2;-catenin target) but also of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which led in a similar manner to reduced cell viability and induction of intrinsic apoptosis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g002">2</xref>).</p><p>PI3K/AKT activation plays an important role in proliferation of cancer cells and also promotes drug resistance by attenuating the antitumoral effect of chemotherapeutics (for a review see [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). For example, DXR-induced activation of AKT seems to be involved in the resistance of breast cancer cells to this drug [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Indeed, our results demonstrate that AKT phosphorylation was also induced in STS cells after only 9 hours of DXR treatment. An increase in AKT phosphorylation may theoretically induce a positive effect on cell viability. However, our results show that the AKT activation by DXR did not increase cell viability compared to control cells. In fact, DXR intercalates between DNA strands, which hinders proliferation. Noteworthy, the antiproliferative effect of DXR alone was relatively weak, especially in synovial sarcoma cells (cell viability decrease of 21.92% at 10 &#x003bc;M) and did not increase in a dose-dependent manner but reached a plateau between 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M after 24 h. These data suggest that AKT phosphorylation may actually represent a compensatory process to counteract the antitumoral effect of DXR. Accordingly, when DXR was combined with UA at concentrations that were able to reduce the DXR-induced AKT activation or with the inhibitor of AKT phosphorylation, TCN, the antiproliferative effect of DXR was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p><p>The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is another essential protein for proliferation, which has been related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although the role of p21 in apoptosis is complex and depends on the cellular context, it was shown that expression of p21 protected tumor cells from DXR-induced apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, it has been suggested that p21 may function as a drug resistance mechanism to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it has been described that AKT can negatively influence the expression of p21. Our study demonstrates that UA reduces p21 expression in synovial sarcoma cells not only when used as single agent but also in the combined treatment with DXR when compared to DXR alone. Accordingly, UA as single agent was accompanied by apoptosis in both STS cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and also diminished significantly cell viability of DXR treatment when used in combination with this drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155946.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>Oleanolic and maslinic acid, structural analogues of UA, also induce apoptosis in SW982 and SK-UT-1 sarcoma cells and sensitize them to DXR [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in those cases the sensitization effect was mediated through the selective inhibition of the multidrug resistance (MDR)-related protein 1 (MRP-1) efflux activity, thereby increasing intracellular DXR. In contrast, in our study UA neither altered uptake of DXR nor increased intracellular DXR concentration in STS cells, suggesting that its molecular mechanism of action is different. It has been recently demonstrated in a variety of tumor cell lines that cellular sensitivity to UA was not linked to the expression or activity of P-glycoprotein or MRP-1, implying indirectly that UA, in contrast to oleanolic and maslinic acid, is probably not a substrate of these multidrug resistant proteins and does not interact with them [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which UA inhibits AKT and downstream targets has not been revealed yet. It is well-known that absorption and accumulation of lipids in cell membranes may affect membrane associated signalling events, including AKT activation, and UA could act in a similar way. In this context, perifosine, an alkylphospholipid that introduces into the plasma membrane and blocks AKT phosphorylation and signalling by disrupting AKT translocation to the plasma membrane, has displayed potent antitumor effects not only in human tumor models [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] but also in clinical phase I/II trials, where it was highly efficient in patients with advanced STS, including leiomyosarcomas and synovial sarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0155946.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study reveals that UA not only exhibits a considerable apoptotic effect on STS cells, but also sensitizes them to the current standard chemotherapeutic for this kind of sarcoma, which is DXR. The presented results provide molecular evidence for a possible use of UA in the treatment of certain STS tumors, in particular, synovial sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. UA is a natural compound present in many dietary components, especially of the Mediterranean diet and, hence, its use as nutraceutical adjuvant together with DXR may ameliorate treatment outcome of patients with STS without increasing the dose of the chemotherapeutic drug or its related toxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155946.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>UA reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> with which DXR inhibited the viability of human STS cells.</title><p>Synovial sarcoma SW982 and leiomyosarcoma SK-UT-1 cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or doxorubicin (DXR) (range 0.1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M) alone or combined simultaneously with UA (10 &#x003bc;M for SW982 cells or 15 &#x003bc;M for SK-UT-1 cells) for 24 h.
