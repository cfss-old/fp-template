In this study we characterized the structure and function of the retina in mice that lacked expression of the rate limiting enzyme in the formation of histamine, histidine decarboxylase (Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse). Using laser capture microdissection, <italic>Hdc</italic> mRNA expression was assessed in the inner and outer nuclear layers of adult C57Bl6J wildtype (WT) and Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-retinae. In adult WT and Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-mice, retinal fundi were imaged, retinal structure was assessed using immunocytochemistry and function was probed by electroretinography. Blood flow velocity was assessed by quantifying temporal changes in the dynamic fluorescein angiography in arterioles and venules. In WT retinae, <italic>Hdc</italic> gene expression was detected in the outer nuclear layer, but not the inner nuclear layer, while the lack of <italic>Hdc</italic> expression was confirmed in the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retina. Preliminary examination of the fundus and retinal structure of the widely used Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mouse strain revealed discrete lesions across the retina that corresponded to areas of photoreceptor abnormality reminiscent of the rd8 (<italic>Crb1</italic>) mutation. This was confirmed after genotyping and the strain designated Hdc<sup>rd8/rd8</sup>. In order to determine the effect of the lack of Hdc-alone on the retina, Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice free of the Crb1 mutation were bred. Retinal fundi appeared normal in these animals and there was no difference in retinal structure, macrogliosis, nor any change in microglial characteristics in Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to wildtype retinae. In addition, retinal function and retinal blood flow dynamics showed no alterations in the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retina. Overall, these results suggest that histamine plays little role in modulating retinal structure and function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by Grant #APP1021918 from the National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) to ELF, UG and a grant from Retina Australia to ELF, UG.

However, there is co-localization of amino acid neurotransmitters with a range of other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the inner retina, within amacrine cells <xref rid="pone.0116025-Vaney1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116025-Dmitrieva1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Histamine is a well characterized neuromodulator of the Central Nervous System (CNS) <xref rid="pone.0116025-Panula1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, however, its role in modulating retinal circuits and vision is less well understood.</p><p>Histamine is produced within mast cells and neurons in the CNS <xref rid="pone.0116025-Panula1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Histamine decarboxylase (Hdc) is the rate limiting enzyme in the formation of histamine, catalyzing the synthesis of histamine from the amino acid L-histidine <xref rid="pone.0116025-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The actions of histamine are mediated by four different histamine receptors (H<sub>1</sub>R-H<sub>4</sub>R) which induce neural effects via G-protein coupled signaling mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0116025-Panula1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Within the CNS, the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus is the principal site for neuronal synthesis of histamine. Histaminergic neurons project from the tuberomammillary nucleus to a widespread number of regions throughout the cortex <xref rid="pone.0116025-Panula2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These histaminergic projections are thought to be important in regulating sleep-wakefulness, feeding and energy balance. Anomalies in its signaling has been associated with a range of disorders including anxiety, depression, narcolepsy and Tourette's syndrome <xref rid="pone.0116025-Panula1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. More recently, a single mutation in the <italic>Hdc</italic> gene (W317X) has been associated with Tourette's syndrome in one family <xref rid="pone.0116025-CastellanBaldan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In the retina, no histamine forming cells have been identified to date. Rather, sparse retinopetal axons arising from the tuberomammillary nucleus extend across the inner plexiform layer eliciting responses in a range of inner retinal neurons <xref rid="pone.0116025-Gastinger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116025-Greferath1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Histamine receptors, H<sub>1</sub>R, H<sub>2</sub>R, H<sub>3</sub>R have been localized to subsets of inner retinal neurons in rodent and primate retinae <xref rid="pone.0116025-Greferath1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116025-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In particular, circuits important in mediating scotopic vision, may be altered by histamine release. Notably, dopaminergic amacrine cells express H<sub>1</sub>R, and display altered intracellular calcium responses, when activated by H<sub>1</sub>R agonists <xref rid="pone.0116025-Frazao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, histamine has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of ON ganglion cells to light, especially under dark adapted conditions <xref rid="pone.0116025-Akimov1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Histamine may also be important in the regulation of ocular blood flow, via alterations in vessel caliber <xref rid="pone.0116025-Zawinka1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116025-Weigert1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recently, histamine signaling has been implicated in the pathology underlying age related macular degeneration (AMD), with H<sub>4</sub>R expression increased in the eyes of AMD patients <xref rid="pone.0116025-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. As this receptor is primarily expressed by macrophages of the eye and the use of antagonists to H<sub>4</sub>R may reduce choroidal neovascularisation <xref rid="pone.0116025-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>A great deal has been learned about the role of histamine in the CNS from examining changes in behavior and function of Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice. For example, Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice display aberrant sleep-wake patterns, reflecting histamine's role in sleep and wakefulness <xref rid="pone.0116025-Parmentier1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, the association between neural dysfunction and the lack of <italic>Hdc</italic> gene expression in humans has been confirmed in studies using the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse with histamine modulating dopamine signaling within the basal ganglia <xref rid="pone.0116025-CastellanBaldan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To date there have been no reports of retinal changes or functional anomalies in the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse. Based on the expression and distribution of histamine receptors within the retina <xref rid="pone.0116025-Greferath1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116025-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and the functional evidence that some retinal neurons are modulated by histamine <xref rid="pone.0116025-Gastinger2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, it is likely that the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse has a retinal phenotype.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in retinal structure and function in Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Based on previous reports that histamine elicits a range of functional changes, especially in the scotopic retinal circuits <xref rid="pone.0116025-Gastinger2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, we predicted that retinal function in Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice would be affected, especially that of amacrine cells. Unexpectedly, our results showed that in the absence of histamine, retinal structure and function was unchanged in the Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wildtype controls. Our results suggest that histamine plays a minor, if any, role in modulating the major rod and cone mediated circuits. However, caution is needed when interpreting results from experiments using Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, since our work revealed that the commonly available strain carries a background mutation in Crb1 that affects retinal structure and photoreceptor viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures concerning animals were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (AEC#1112259) and were conducted in accordance with guidelines set by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Briefly, Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were originally created by replacing intron 5 to exon 9 of the murine <italic>Hdc</italic> gene with an inverted PGK promoter driven neomycin phosphotransferase gene. This lead to targeted deletion of exon 8, which contains the coding sequence for the putative binding site for pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate, the coenzyme of Hdc protein. Control, wildtype C57Bl6 mice (WT), and Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were housed at the Animal Research Facility of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia under standard conditions with food and water provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> in a 12 hour light, 12 hour dark cycle.

We first verified that Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lack histamine using antisera specific to histamine in brain sections containing the tuberomammillary nucleus as described previously (Greferath et al 2009).

More work is necessary, however, to gain a better understanding of why Hdc is present in the outer retina and whether histamine plays a role in modifying specific retinal circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116025.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Histamine labelling is absent in Hdc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.
