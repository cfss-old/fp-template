It was proportionately more common in African and Caribbean ethnic groups. Two clinical subtypes were identified: the more common was a subacute optic neuropathy resembling optic neuritis; a more slowly progressive optic neuropathy arose in the remaining 17%. Sixteen (31%) were bilateral. Concurrent intraocular inflammation was seen in 36%. Pain arose in only 27% of cases. An optic perineuritis was seen in 2 cases, and predominate involvement of the chiasm in one. MRI findings showed optic nerve involvement in 75% of cases, with adjacent and more widespread inflammation in 31%. Treatment with corticosteroids was helpful in those with an inflammatory optic neuropathy, but not those with mass lesions. Relapse of visual signs arose in 25% of cases, necessitating an increase or escalation of treatment, but relapse was not a poor prognostic factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is a large prospective study of the clinical characteristics and outcome of treatment in optic neuropathy associated with sarcoidosis. Patients who experience an inflammatory optic neuropathy respond to treatment but may relapse.

The age range was wide but the condition was more prevalent in the first half of life. The majority of patients were women and there were equal numbers in Caucasian and African or Caribbean ethnic groups. According to the epidemiologic findings in ACCESS, the ethnic subgroups in London are 60% Caucasian, 14% African and Caribbean, and 18% South Asian, and our results therefore suggest a greater prevalence of the disease in African and Caribbean people who live in London.</p><p>In general, the clinical syndrome resembled an optic neuritis,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> although in some, the disease course was more slowly progressive. Pain was a less prevalent feature than is seen in demyelinating optic neuritis, and the median visual acuity at nadir was equivalent, although more were no perception of light (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>). However, none of the features observed was specific to sarcoidosis in this series. Sixty-four percent had a unilateral involvement, 28% presented at a later time with involvement of the second eye, while synchronous bilateral involvement was less common (9%). It is noteworthy that there was evidence for concurrent intraocular inflammation in only a minority of cases. Predominately this was mild (although more severe cases had been excluded because of the uncertainty of the pathogenesis of the optic neuropathy). Indeed, in 64% of patients, there was no history of ocular involvement at any stage of the disease to date. Imaging showed clear abnormalities, which accounted for the clinical features in 75% of cases. The majority showed high signal within the nerve, with or without enhancement.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of clinical features with results of the ONSG<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NEURIMMINFL2015008763TT2"/></table-wrap><p>Spontaneous improvement occurred (as has been noted previously<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>), although the majority of patients were treated with steroids. Following this, an often substantial improvement in vision took place, even after several weeks without treatment. There was no relationship between nadir acuity and final acuity. Relapse occurred in 25% of cases, necessitating recommencement or an escalation of treatment, and in the majority, this occurred early, as steroids were withdrawn. Relapse itself was not a marker of poor visual outcome. Repeated relapse was treated successfully with addition of immunosuppression.</p><p>Six cases (11%) had a more progressive disease course and were shown to have a more widespread neurologic involvement, each showing evidence for adjacent meningeal inflammation. Visual outcome in this subgroup was poor, even though the disease process required, in general, a higher and more prolonged dose of steroids, concurrent immunosuppression, and in 2 cases, a requirement for biological agents with refractory disease. Evidence for neurosarcoidosis defined as the presence of intracranial meningeal enhancement arose in 16 cases overall&#x02014;all of those with a progressive course and 10 with a subacute course.</p><p>Involvement of the optic nerve in sarcoidosis may arise through a variety of mechanisms: inflammation of the nerve itself,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> compression or infiltration by an inflammatory mass adjacent to the anterior visual pathway (e.g., the orbital apex or pituitary gland),<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> secondary involvement through ischemic complications of retinal and choroidal inflammation and glaucoma,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> granulomas within the disc itself,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> meningeal inflammation within the optic nerve sheath leading to an optic perineuritis,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and finally as a consequence of hydrocephalus.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Optic neuropathy is not common in sarcoidosis. It was seen in 5% of one series of 202 patients with ocular disease in sarcoidosis,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> but only one in a series of 649 patients with systemic sarcoidosis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and none in another of 285.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the literature before 2000, 57 cases had been published, of which 35 involved the optic nerve itself, 9 compression due to an intracerebral lesion, 6 due to hydrocephalus, and 6 due to the complications of uveitis.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Many noted that bilateral involvement occurred and that imaging showed enlargement of the optic nerve&#x02013;sheath complex.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Others<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> noted that the acuity was lower than that seen in a demyelinating optic neuritis. More recent series from the United States have studied larger patient numbers. One study<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> described 24 cases with optic neuropathy: 71% had not been known previously to have systemic sarcoidosis and 42% showed previous or current intraocular inflammation. The clinical features were very similar to those in our series. Another<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> showed that 14 of 67 patients known to have neurologic sarcoidosis had some form of optic neuropathy.</p><p>We have identified a small subgroup of patients in whom the serum ACE is elevated at presentation and then subsequently normalizes without relapse. On further investigation, these patients do not have sarcoidosis and on follow-up show no sign of transformation into a more widespread disease. The serum ACE appears to increase in a nonspecific way and appears not to indicate a systemic granulomatous disease. It is important to identify this subgroup, which requires no additional treatment, merely close follow-up and observation.</p><p>This large series of patients with optic neuropathy in conjunction with sarcoidosis has shown that more than half are not previously diagnosed with sarcoidosis, only a third have concurrent intraocular inflammation, and the clinical characteristics and in most cases the imaging features are not substantially different from that seen in a regular demyelinating optic neuritis. However, patients should be identified early because the response to treatment may lessen with time, and the identification of more widespread disease, particularly within the nervous system, will require prolonged, often high-dose treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and modern biological therapies. Modern imaging investigations including PET may make identification of these cases easier, but a high index of clinical suspicion is still important, particularly in non-Caucasian patients presenting with a painless optic neuritis.</p><p>Once identified, we recommend that patients be treated with high-dose (oral or IV) corticosteroids, followed by a slow taper watching carefully for relapse as the dose is reduced. Repeated relapses, particularly preventing steroid dose reduction, should be treated with an additional immunosuppressive agent. The presence of neurosarcoidosis requires more prolonged higher-dose treatment with steroids and immunosuppression from the outset, with early recourse to biological agents should the clinical and radiologic features of the disorder fail to improve quickly. Further study is required to identify precisely which treatments are best and over what period of time.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="contributions"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p content-type="contributions">Dr. Kidd was responsible for the study design, data acquisition, analysis and interpretation, and writing the manuscript.
