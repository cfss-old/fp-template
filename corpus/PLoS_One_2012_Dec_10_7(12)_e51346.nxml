Atherosclerosis develops in this region, and atherosclerotic plaques in the vertebrobasilar confluence can progress with catastrophic consequences, including artery occlusion. Quantitative assessments of the flow characteristics in the VBS could elucidate the factors that influence flow patterns in this confluence, and deviations from normal patterns might then be used to predict locations to monitor for potential pathological changes, to detect early signs of disease, and to evaluate treatment options and efficacy. In this study, high-field MRI was used in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate the hemodynamics of subject-specific confluence models (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) and to identify different geometrical classes of vertebrobasilar systems (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12) of healthy adult subjects. The curvature of the vessels and their mutual orientation significantly affected flow parameters in the VBS. The basilar artery geometry strongly influenced both skewing of the velocity profiles and the wall shear stress distributions in the VBS. All five subjects modeled possessed varying degrees of vertebral asymmetry, and helical flow was observed in four cases, suggesting that factors other than vertebral asymmetry influence mixing of the vertebral artery flow contributions. These preliminary studies verify that quantitative, MR imaging techniques in conjunction with subject-specific CFD models of healthy adult subjects may be used to characterize VBS hemodynamics and to predict flow features that have been related to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis in large arteries. This work represents an important first step towards applying this approach to study disease initiation and progression in the VBS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>American Heart Association (AHA) 10POST3450046 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heart.org">www.heart.org</ext-link>), National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH/NIBIB 5T32 EB001628-07 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>), and NIH/NCRR UL1 RR024975-01 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>).

Located proximal to the Circle of Willis, the basilar artery is the primary supply to the posterior brain. Manifestations of disease in this confluence, including vertebrobasilar dissection and occlusion, can have significant consequences. Although it accounts for only approximately 1% of all ischemic strokes, acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) occurs in younger patients (mean age 60 vs. 71 years in all-cause ischemic stroke) and results in greater risk for in-hospital death than all other causes of ischemic stroke (30% vs. 8% in-hospital mortality) and generally poorer functional outcomes (in nearly 80% of surviving patients) upon release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-IsraeliKorn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Schonewille1">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The vertebrobasilar confluence is not geometrically as typical a location for developing atherosclerosis as are bifurcations or curves, but Ravensbergen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Ravensbergen1">[3]</xref> identified plaque at the apex of the VBS in 50% of human cadavers examined. Of the 11 vertebrobasilar systems with plaque that they investigated in-depth, nine cases were severe. The integrated plaque thickness along the basilar artery at the lateral walls was significantly greater than that at the anterior and posterior walls of the vessel, and the plaque thickness decreased along the basilar artery. When one vertebral artery was larger than the other, the plaque thickness on the lateral wall of the basilar artery was greater on the same side as the dominant vertebral. This statistically significant difference in the circumferential localization of basilar artery plaque implicates a role for hemodynamics in the development of atherosclerosis at this location. Moreover, in other vasculature, local flow characteristics such as areas of low and oscillating wall shear stress (WSS) and recirculation regions correlate strongly with atherosclerosis initiation, development, and vulnerability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Caro1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Tropea1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Previous hemodynamic studies investigated flow in idealized, planar, vertebrobasilar systems, analyzing the effect of asymmetry (diameter or flow rate differences) between the contributing vertebral vessels and of confluence shape and angle on the flow field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Jozwik1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Ravensbergen3">[11]</xref>.

In addition, an MR angiography study observed a relationship between vertebral size and flow mixture in the basilar artery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Smith1">[13]</xref>. Although these differences explain some large-scale flow patterns in vertebrobasilar systems with relatively simple, planar geometries, they are insufficient for describing the time-resolved flow fields in real vessels with three-dimensional geometries, and there remains a need for a non-invasive quantitative characterization of hemodynamics in healthy, younger adult subjects, particularly with respect to pathophysiologically-relevant parameters.</p><p>Clinical imaging-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations previously have been used to successfully evaluate hemodynamics and can provide three-dimensional descriptions of flow fields. (For a thorough review, see Steinman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Steinman1">[14]</xref>.)

In addition, we compared geometric variations across subjects and used these to refine descriptions of different vertebrobasilar configurations. Previous patient-specific models have investigated flow in basilar aneurysm models, but the relationship between atherosclerosis development and hemodynamics in this arterial confluence remains to be fully elucidated. Understanding the precise characteristics of flow in the healthy VBS will provide the knowledge base needed for future studies designed to elucidate the factors that affect flow patterns in this system. One major long-term aim is to identify and distinguish variations in these patterns in order to predict potential locations to monitor for pathology, identify early signs of pathology, determine prognosis, and evaluate treatment options or efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board, and signed informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to their participation in the study.

Consequently, the high velocity region in these Walking geometries resides along the left side of the confluence. This effect is most evident in A, which also exhibits strong basilar artery curvature. Additionally, the ratio of flow from the contributing arteries in conjunction with the direction of vertebral artery approach influence velocity profile shape. As seen in A, flow from the RV, which is greater than that of the LV, impinges on the left wall of the basilar artery, swirling upward and causing the velocity profile to skew to the outer surface of the basilar artery curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051346-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This RV flow direction forces the core LV flow in the proximal basilar to the posterior wall, resulting in slight posterior displacement of the maximum velocity peak. Unlike the other Walking geometry, the LV flow in B is greater than the RV flow and the basilar artery is relatively straight. Therefore, the double-peaked velocity profile in the confluence merges distally into a single peak that resides along the left wall of the basilar artery due to the continuation of the LV core flow, and this single peak spreads along the posterior wall of the distal basilar, suggesting that inflow ratio and vessel curvature collectively influence flow patterns.</p><sec id="s3d1"><title>Tuning fork geometry</title><p>The basilar artery curves in both the Tuning Fork geometries (C and D). This curvature causes the maximum velocity region to localize at the outer wall of the basilar artery curve. Velocity profiles in both the Tuning Fork geometries (C and D) are influenced by the basilar curvature. In C, the basilar artery is rather straight until the most distal portion, at which point it curves; consequently, the flow is roughly parallel and the velocity profile peak is rather central in the proximal basilar artery but evident along the anterior side at the distal portion. In contrast, the basilar artery of D is strongly curved, and the high momentum fluid resides along the curve&#x02019;s outer wall.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>Lambda geometry</title><p>In the Lambda geometry (E), velocity distributions are predominantly influenced by basilar artery curvature. In E, although the RV is the larger of the contributing arteries, the peak velocity skews toward the right-anterior wall of the proximal basilar artery because the high momentum core of the LV impacts the RV flow, shifting the velocity peak to the right-anterior side in the confluence and proximal basilar artery. More distally, the basilar artery curvature heavily influences the form of the axial velocity profiles in the Lambda geometry (E), and the high momentum fluid resides near the outer wall of the basilar artery curve. These results further support our findings that inflow ratio and vessel curvature synergistically affect local flow patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Pathlines</title><p>Pathlines, colored by the vertebral artery of origin, were determined for the five simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051346-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The pathlines shown are for the simulation time point just prior to peak systole; however, the patterns were qualitatively similar throughout the cardiac cycle. The vertebrobasilar systems in which the RV flow rate is larger than that of the LV (A, D, and E) exhibit flow from the RV (yellow) swirling around flow originating from the LV (red), consequently pushing the LV flow to the inner wall of the proximal basilar curve. In E this inner basilar curve LV flow is slightly shifted to the left side of the basilar. As the vertebral arteries join in B, in which LV flow is greater than RV by 2.2-fold, flow from the LV (red) pushes RV flow (yellow) toward the right side, encompassing the RV flow distally. In C (LV flow&#x0003e;RV flow), the flows from the contributing vertebral arteries do not mix in the basilar artery but remain on the same side as their artery of origin.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Average WSS and OSI</title><p>Local regions of low WSS (defined as WSS&#x0003c;1 Pa) occurred at the crux of the junction in all subjects, and these low WSS foci develop even when there exists locally high WSS banding around both feeding arteries just proximal of the junction (e.g. A). In this region, high momentum streams from the vertebral arteries combine in the center of the basilar lumen, thus forcing high momentum fluid away from the junction of the feeding arteries. Further, the sudden expansion of the cross-sectional area causes a rapid decrease in the WSS at the junction apex.

In addition to varying LV and RV diameter asymmetries, the shapes of the apex and confluence vary widely between subjects.

They demonstrated that for steady flow in both symmetric (equal flow in the vertebral arteries) and asymmetric (one vertebral artery has higher flow than the other) confluences an M-shaped axial velocity profile merges into one peak, which in the symmetric confluence develops and remains in the center of the basilar artery. In their asymmetric confluence, the M-shaped profile at the confluence is higher on the side that receives flow from the vertebral artery with greater flow, but along the length of the basilar artery the two peaks merge, and the maximum crosses the artery to skew toward the opposite wall before drifting back toward the center of the vessel.

Our CFD results suggest factors other than flow ratio are involved, including the curvature of the vessels and their orientation to each other, which can be addressed by analysis of their shape, particularly basilar artery curvature.

It is important to note that the WSS calculated in this study is calculated for the entire rigid model surface from the simulated flow field, not at a discrete location in a single artery from <italic>in vivo</italic> data acquired at the location.</p><p>Previously, oscillatory shear was shown to correlate with intimal thickening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Ku1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-He1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Moore1">[43]</xref> and endothelial permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Himburg1">[44]</xref>. In four of the five vertebrobasilar models, OSI foci were present at or near the confluence apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051346-g008">Figure 8</xref>), which Ravensbergen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-Ravensbergen1">[3]</xref> identified as a site of atherosclerosis development. The OSI contours and WSS distributions did not have the same level of agreement as shown in He and Ku <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051346-He1">[29]</xref>, although the OSI foci tended to correspond with low WSS regions. The small fraction of model surface with OSI &#x02265;0.005 suggests that flow reversal occurs fleetingly or in focalized areas in these models. In branching vasculature, regions of adverse pressure gradient develop that can lead to reversed flow. These branch points are absent in the merging geometry of the vertebrobasilar system.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we describe the use of high-resolution MR angiography and <italic>in vivo</italic> quantitative flow measurements by PCMR in conjunction with CFD to develop subject-specific models of the VBS for non-invasively characterizing the physiological hemodynamics of the confluence. It is the first report of WSS distributions in the vertebrobasilar systems of healthy young adult subjects, and we have demonstrated that flow features (e.g. velocity profiles, WSS distributions) in these models are related to both the geometry and the relative flow rates of the system, which vary between normal subjects. The influence of geometrical features on the WSS distributions transcends inter-subject geometry differences. Further, the vertebrobasilar system is unique in the human body because it is the location where two large arteries merge into another vessel. Thus, understanding hemodynamics of this native, successful merge may offer insight for improved design of biomedical devices that involve merging flow (e.g. grafts, pumps).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0051346-IsraeliKorn1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Israeli-Korn</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schwammenthal</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yonash-Kimchi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bakon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tsabari</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>Ischemic Stroke Due to Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion: Proportion and Outcomes</article-title>. <source>Israel Med Assoc J</source><volume>12(11)</volume>: <fpage>671</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>675</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0051346-Schonewille1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schonewille</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Algra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Serena</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Molina</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kappelle</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>Outcome in Patients with Basilar Artery Occlusion Treated Conventionally</article-title>. <source>J Neuro Neurosurg Psych</source><volume>76(9)</volume>: <fpage>1238</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1241</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0051346-Ravensbergen1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ravensbergen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ravensbergen</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Krijger</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hillen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hoogstraten</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name> (<year>1998</year>) <article-title>Localizing Role of Hemodynamics in Atherosclerosis in Several Human Vertebrobasilar Junction Geometries</article-title>. <source>Arterio Thromb Vasc Bio</source><volume>18(5)</volume>: <fpage>708</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>716</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0051346-Caro1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Caro CG, Pedley TT, Schroter RC, Seed WA (1978) The Mechanics of the Circulation.
