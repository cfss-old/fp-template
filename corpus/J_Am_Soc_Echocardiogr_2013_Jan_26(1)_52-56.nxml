Consequently, subjective echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular (RV) function is still routinely undertaken. The aims of this study were to compare this with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), investigate the impact of experience and training on the accuracy of subjective assessment, and critically analyze the role of echocardiography to detect impaired systolic function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A retrospective analysis of prospectively acquired data was performed. Children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent routine preoperative cardiac MRI and echocardiography under the same general anesthetic. Echocardiograms were reviewed, and members of the congenital heart disease team with differing echocardiography experience subjectively graded RV systolic function (good, moderate, or poor). This was compared with MRI-derived ejection fraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-eight patients at different palliative stages were included. Twenty-eight observers were divided into five experience categories (congenital heart disease junior trainees to attending cardiologists). Median agreement was 47.6% (range, 31.4%&#x02013;58.2%), with the lowest agreement among junior trainees and the highest among attending cardiologists. When used as a screening test for poor RV systolic function, the median sensitivity of echocardiography was 0.89 (range, 0.86&#x02013;0.96), and median specificity was 0.45 (range, 0.26&#x02013;0.55). The highest sensitivity was observed among junior trainees but with the lowest specificity. The highest specificity was observed among attending cardiologists (0.55).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Agreement between echocardiographic and MRI RV ejection fraction improves with experience but remains suboptimal. When used as a screening test for poor RV function, echocardiography is sensitive, but specificity is heavily influenced by operator experience.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>Echocardiography</kwd><kwd>Experience</kwd><kwd>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>CI, Confidence interval</kwd><kwd>EF, Ejection fraction</kwd><kwd>HLHS, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome</kwd><kwd>MRI, Magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>RV, Right ventricular</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) describes a spectrum of underdevelopment of the left heart that renders it incapable of supporting the systemic arterial circulation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The current management approach includes three staged surgeries<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> carried out over the first few years of the child's life; the resulting circulation is maintained by a systemic right ventricle.

In the clinical care of patients with HLHS, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> is the imaging method used to provide objective measurement of ventricular volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and flow. MRI usually requires general anesthesia or sedation in younger children and is expensive, is not portable, and requires a level of expertise not universally available.

As secondary aims, we sought to investigate the impact of observer training and experience on the correlation of echocardiographic and MRI methods, as well as the performance of echocardiography when used as a screening test to detect reduced RV EF measured on MRI.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><p>Ethical and institutional approval was granted and informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians. All patients with HLHS (defined as mitral stenosis or atresia with aortic stenosis or atresia and atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance) undergoing cardiac MRI under general anesthesia were included in the study. At our institution, cardiac MRI is routinely used in combination with echocardiography before hemi-Fontan and total cavopulmonary connection as well as for patients after total cavopulmonary connection. Therefore, all patients with HLHS undergo MRI before hemi-Fontan and total cavopulmonary connection. Patients were excluded if parental consent was not given or if there was cardiovascular instability during the MRI scan, precluding additional time for echocardiography. Data were prospectively acquired but retrospectively analyzed for this study.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>MRI Acquisition</title><p>MRI scans were performed on a Philips 1.5-T Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) and were reevaluated using ViewForum EWS version 2.0 (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). Two-dimensional steady-state free precession cine imaging oriented to the short axis of the right ventricle was used to calculate ventricular volumes using the disk summation method. End-diastolic and end-systolic contours were manually traced (excluding major trabeculations from the volume) to determine end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and EF.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> MRI EF was categorized as used in our clinical department: good function (&#x02265;50%), moderate function (40%&#x02013;49%), or poor function (&#x0003c;40%).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Echocardiographic Acquisition</title><p>Echocardiography was undertaken immediately after the MRI scan under the same general anesthetic to avoid potential physiologic changes. Comprehensive echocardiography was performed on a Philips iE33 ultrasound system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA). Subcostal, apical, long-axis, and short-axis views were obtained, whenever acoustic windows permitted. Two-dimensional cine images (no color) were anonymized and reviewed by a range of observers working within the department of congenital heart disease with varying levels of experience of echocardiography in this patient group. Observers were blinded to the MRI results. Each observer was asked on the basis of the images to categorize global RV systolic function as good, moderate, or poor consistent with the normal subjective description in clinical use at our institution. This method has been used previously to compare echocardiography and MRI in both the biventricular and single-ventricle setting.<xref rid="bib12 bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,14</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Observer Grouping</title><p>Observers were grouped by experience level: residents with &#x0003c;6 months' exposure to echocardiography (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;= 5), junior fellows with &#x0003c;3 years of training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;= 6), senior fellows with &#x0003e;3 years of training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;= 5), cardiac physiologists (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;= 5), and attending cardiologists (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;= 7). Further delineation of the experience of each group is given in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Observers were scored on the basis of the concordance of their visual assessment of RV systolic function on echocardiography with MRI EF (0 if concordant, 1 if a single functional echocardiographic grade different, and 2 if functional echocardiographic grade differed by two grades compared with the MRI scan). For example, if an MRI EF was good (&#x0003e;50%) and the observer rated it as poor echocardiographically, this was considered two grades different. Each observer was given a total score (calculated from the total of grades different); this was then averaged for each observer experience group. Thus, a low score means that there was a high level of agreement between the echocardiographic assessment and MRI, and a high score indicates worse agreement between the echocardiographic and MRI methods. To evaluate variability in assessment in each observer group, intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated within in each observer group (two-way random, absolute agreement).</p><p>An important clinical consideration is the ability of echocardiography to accurately detect reduced RV systolic function. If an RV EF of &#x0003c;50% assessed by MRI is regarded as &#x0201c;reduced function,&#x0201d; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of subjective echocardiographic function were calculated for each observer group. Echocardiographically assessed moderate or poor function was taken to indicate reduced function.</p><p>All MRI scans were analyzed by two observers (H.R.B.-R. and A.J.B.). All echocardiograms were graded for quality by the same two observers. Scans were graded from 1 (poor quality) to 4 (excellent quality). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to assess interobserver variation for MRI analysis (two-way random, absolute agreement).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-eight patients with HLHS underwent echocardiography under the same general anesthetic as MRI between July 2007 and January 2009.

Twenty-three patients (82%) had MRI EFs &#x02265; 50%, four (14%) had MRI EFs of 40% to 49%, and one (4%) had an MRI EF &#x0003c; 40%. The median MRI EF for the whole group was 59% (range, 33%&#x02013;78%).</p><p>Interobserver variability for MRI analysis showed good concordance. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.945 (95th confidence interval [CI], 0.741&#x02013;0.91), 0.952 (95% CI, 0.779&#x02013;0.984), 0.926 (95% CI, 0.780&#x02013;0.970), and 0.885 (95% CI, 0.764&#x02013;0.946) for end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and EF, respectively.</p><p>When evaluating the echocardiograms, there was a trend toward improved concordance with increasing experience (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Attending cardiologists assessed the grade of function the same as MRI in 58.2% of patients, compared with 55% of senior fellows, 47.1% of cardiac physiologists, 47.6% of junior fellows, and 31.4% of residents. Concordance within each observer group also increased with increasing experience, from 0.674 (95% CI, 0.440&#x02013;0.831) in residents to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.789&#x02013;0.936) in attending cardiologists. Twenty-one echocardiograms (75%) were rated as having good to excellent quality clips; all loops were included to reflect the normal clinical situation of varying quality of images. It was noted that concordance with MRI in those with less than good to excellent images was lower than those with good to excellent clips (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>For the analysis of the performance of subjective echocardiographic assessment to detect reduced RV EF (&#x0003c;50%) by MRI, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (on the basis of group averages) are shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>. All observer groups had sensitivity &#x0003e; 0.80, with the highest sensitivity (0.96) observed in residents.

Although many qualitative techniques to determine systolic and diastolic function have been described,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> these have not been fully investigated in patients with HLHS and are not used in routine clinical practice. Additionally, the echocardiographer must deal with limited views, particularly in the postoperative period, and with the compliance of infants and young children. Therefore, more simple indices such as tricuspid annular displacement<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and an operator-dependent subjective assessment of RV systolic function are still commonly used despite evidence to suggest that subjective evaluation of the ventricular function in single-ventricle circulations correlates poorly with MRI.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Subjective assessment may also be affected by differences seen in regional wall motion, as can be seen in those with different residual left ventricular morphologies.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>In this retrospective study, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of subjective assessment of RV systolic function in patients with HLHS, as well as investigating whether this was determined by operator experience. We have shown that visual assessment of RV systolic function has only a limited correlation with MRI EF but that this appears to improve with increasing levels of experience (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Even in the most experienced group of echocardiographers, the echocardiographic grade of function was discordant with MRI assessment in &#x0003e;40% of cases. This variation with experience has obvious clinical implications, especially in the situation in which it may be a more junior member of the medical team performing the echocardiographic study. It highlights the importance of recognizing the skills and limitations of those undertaking echocardiography in this patient group and the need to ensure appropriate review.</p><p>An important role of echocardiography in the sequential assessment of patients with HLHS is to detect RV dysfunction. Our analysis of echocardiography to detect reduced RV EF (&#x0003c;50%) on the basis of MRI was undertaken to address this question. The observer group with the highest sensitivity to identify reduced RV EF was the residents, who have the least echocardiographic experience. This finding was matched, however, by the lowest specificity for residents, in contrast to the highest specificity observed among attending cardiologists, the most experienced group. We speculate that because of the important clinical implications of RV dysfunction in this patient group, that less experienced observers will &#x0201c;overcall&#x0201d; echocardiographically reduced RV systolic function to avoid missing patients with clinically significant ventricular impairment. More experienced observers may be more likely to trust their assessments of echocardiograms and be more confident that ventricular impairment is absent. If echocardiographic judgment of impaired ventricular function leads to further corroborative imaging such as MRI, then fewer patients would be referred for such imaging in the hands of more experienced observers.</p><p>The improvement seen with increasing experience is likely to be due to increased exposure to both echocardiography and MRI, often in the context of cardiac surgical conferences, where decisions are made with respect to patient management. Our results emphasize the need for more robust and objective echocardiographic tools for the sequential assessment of patients with HLHS. This is particularly important because of the noninvasive nature and ready repeatability of echocardiographic techniques for sequential assessment. Methods using Doppler tissue imaging and speckle tracking are currently being investigated<xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16-19</sup></xref> and may prove useful in this group.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The majority of patients had MRI EF in the normal range. This is likely to represent a degree of selection bias, as those with very poor function are at greater risk for mortality.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> We included all patients at any surgical stage because of the small numbers of patients involved and to reflect clinical practice, but we acknowledge that there is a potential influence of different loading conditions. There are inherent problems in comparing a two-dimensional technique such as echocardiography, in which assessment of function is based on myocardial motion, with a three-dimensional technique using measurement of volume changes (MRI). RV EF on MRI does not necessarily reflect systolic function but has been used here as a surrogate in the absence of other proven reliable measures. We acknowledge additionally that we have compared a continuous variable (MRI EF using arbitrary cutoffs) with a categorical variable, but this method has been used in previous studies.<xref rid="bib12 bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,14</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shown that subjective assessment of RV function in patients with HLHS is limited but improves with increasing experience. This has important clinical implications, as junior staff members perform the majority of assessments, particularly in the immediate postoperative period, and emphasizes the importance of ongoing training and supervision. Objective echocardiographic measures to reliably measure RV function in these patients are required. Ideally, these would be simple, reproducible, and not altered by the patient's operative stage, loading conditions, or morphologic
