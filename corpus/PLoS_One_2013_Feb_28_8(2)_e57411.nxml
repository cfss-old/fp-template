This ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) is characterized by mismatch of local tissue oxygen supply and local cellular energy demand and results in sublethal or lethal injuries to the tubular epithelium and neighbouring cell structures which is clinically detected as compromised glomerular filtration rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Nash1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Schrier1">[5]</xref>. Despite substantial progress in the field of AKI including biomarker discovery and renal replacement therapy dosing, there is an unmet need to better understand the mechanisms operative during the initial phase of ischemic AKI. Treatments targeting processes operative before the onset of sublethal or lethal cellular injuries would have great clinical impact. Animal models are well suited to study mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and helped to define the injury phases of initiation, extension and regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Bonventre1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Thadhani1">[8]</xref>.

However, lack of adequate diagnostic tools capable to determine spatio-temporal distribution of oxygenation during the phases of renal ischemia/reperfusion precluded elucidation of events taking place immediately after initiation of ischemia and reperfusion.</p><p>Non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging holds the promise to elucidate spatio-temporal pathophysiological changes in the kidney by monitoring the early phases of ischemia and reperfusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meets the needs of non-invasive renal <italic>in-vivo</italic> imaging. Parametric MRI can provide maps of the MR relaxation parameters T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub>, which are known to be blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Silvennoinen1">[13]</xref>. The BOLD effect relies on the paramagnetic property of deoxygenated hemoglobin. A signal attenuation in T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted MR images occurs if the volume fraction of deoxygenated hemoglobin increases. T<sub>2</sub>* or its reciprocal value (R<sub>2</sub>*&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/T<sub>2</sub>*) have been used in numerous clinical and preclinical studies as a surrogate of renal (blood) oxygenation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Prasad1">[14]</xref>. Renal R<sub>2</sub>* has even been suggested to display a close correlation with renal tissue pO<sub>2</sub> levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Pedersen1">[15]</xref>, and R<sub>2</sub>*-mapping has been deemed ideally suited for the evaluation of intra-renal oxygenation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Prasad1">[14]</xref>.

Due to technical limitations, none of these studies focused on high temporal resolution continuous parametric MRI based <italic>in-vivo</italic> monitoring during ischemia &#x02013; and in particular during early reperfusion of the kidney. We sought to establish the feasibility high temporal resolution longitudinal T<sub>2</sub>*/T<sub>2</sub> mapping throughout I/R. To meet this goal an I/R model that affords remote induction of ischemia/reperfusion inside an MR scanner is implemented together with a standardized segmentation model of the rat kidney. This integrated approach enabled for the first time the monitoring of renal T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> in the initial reperfusion phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines provided and approved by the Animal Welfare Department of the <italic>Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit und Soziales</italic> Berlin (Berlin State Office of Health and Social Affairs, permit numbers G00121/11, G0059/12). All experiments were carried out under urethane anesthesia (20% in saline, 6 ml/kg body mass, intra-peritoneal), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Animals were kept under constant thermal conditions: 37&#x000b0;C body temperature was maintained by warming the animal beds using a circulating heated water system (Thermo Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany).

Subsequently, parametric T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> mapping using respiratory gated imaging techniques was performed. For T<sub>2</sub>* mapping a multi gradient echo (MGE) sequence (repetition time&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50 ms, echo times&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10, first echo time&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.43 ms, echo spacing 2.14 ms, averages&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4) was employed with a total acquisition time of approx. 1 min 20 s (respiratory rate dependent).

The relaxation times T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> were chosen over the relaxivities (i.e. R<sub>2</sub>*&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/T<sub>2</sub>* and R<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/T<sub>2</sub>), as they allow for a better visualization of changes in the parameter maps for the different kidney regions and stimuli. In quantitative data representations such as value tables or bar charts the relaxation times are complemented by the corresponding relativities, which were also derived on a pixel-by-pixel basis.</p><p>Movements of the kidney during I/R experiments were compensated by image registration (FLIRT, FSL, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>) using the first echo images of the multi-echo MGE or MSME acquisitions. Images were registered onto a baseline scan and the resulting spatial transformation matrices applied to the corresponding parameter maps.</p><p>Mean T<sub>2</sub>* (R<sub>2</sub>*) and T<sub>2</sub> (R<sub>2</sub>) values for several regions-of-interest (ROI) within the renal cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla were calculated from the parameter maps. To reduce operator-induced variability in the ROI placement a standardized segmentation model of the rat kidney was developed. For this purpose special care was taken with regard to the location of the ROIs in the kidney. The aim was to determine ROIs strictly according to morphological kidney features, i.e., the distinct renal layers: cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057411-g001"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>). To this end, the dimensions of the rat kidney layers were measured in a series of freshly harvested kidneys as well as in a series of formalin-fixed kidneys (altogether 16 kidneys). To account for the inter-individual variability of the absolute length (cranial to caudal extremities) and width (lateral to medial border) of the kidneys, a rectangular frame that tightly encloses the kidney in the coronal view was used as a reference. The segmentation model consists of nine ROIs at defined relative positions (percentages of both diameters) within this rectangular reference frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057411-g001"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>). The size and positions of nine ROIs were defined for three ROIs in the renal cortex (COR), for three ROIs in the outer medulla (OM), and for three ROIs in the inner medulla (IM). All ROIs were placed in safe distance from the borders between these kidney layers to avoid any &#x02018;contamination&#x02019; from the neighboring layers (partial segment effects) and to allow for inter-individual variations in morphology without the need to change the ROI position. The implementation of this model in a semi-automated analysis program developed in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>) limited user interaction to the placement of the rectangular reference frame around the kidney. The automatically placed ROIs were overlaid onto the parameter maps and their position was visually validated. ROIs that included artifacts were excluded from further analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0057411-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0057411.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Standardized segmentation model of the rat kidney that is used to place regions-of-interest (ROI) in the cortex (C1,C2,C3), the outer medulla (O1,O2,O3) and the inner medulla (I1,I2,I3).</title><p><bold>A)</bold> Segmentation model overlaid onto a photograph of a freshly excised coronal view of a rat kidney.

This approach allowed tracking of T<sub>2</sub>*/T<sub>2</sub> in the kidney during I/R with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Our study provides a technical advance in the field, as only snapshot images acquired before and after induction of injury were previously analyzed in I/R models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Rognant1">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Oostendorp1">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The proposed segmentation model of the rat kidney served to reduce operator-induced variability compared to manually drawn regions-of-interest used in similar studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Rognant1">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Ji1">[19]</xref>. Taking into account that the histological borders among the kidney layers are rather undulating, extra care was taken to leave a generous spacing between the ROIs in the cortex and the outer medulla, and between the ROIs in the outer and the inner medulla to avoid partial segment effects. Thus, parametric MRI data of these ROIs can be attributed exactly to the respective morphological layer.</p><p>T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> changes were observed for all kidney regions shortly after induction of renal ischemia and during the initial reperfusion phase, which remained stable throughout the monitored reperfusion period. These findings could help to support the hypothesis that key events for the initiation of injury occur immediately after reperfusion, if a link to observations at later time points (e.g. 6&#x02013;48 hours) can be established in future studies. In this study the surgical/experimental procedures were adapted for performing <italic>in vivo</italic> I/R experiments inside of an MR scanner; they do not allow for a recovery of the animal and additional MRI at later time points.</p><p>Considering the oxygenation-sensitivity of T<sub>2</sub>* (R<sub>2</sub>*) measurements during hypoxia, the immediate decline of T<sub>2</sub>* at the onset of ischemia, and the accordance with reports on invasively measured tissue pO<sub>2</sub> during ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Hoff1">[12]</xref>, it is reasonable to attribute the detected T<sub>2</sub>* (R<sub>2</sub>*) changes primarily to variations in intrarenal blood oxygenation. Still, T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> may only be surrogates for physiological parameters of interest, such as renal blood oxygenation. The influence of numerous other physical and physiological parameters on T<sub>2</sub>*/T<sub>2</sub> variations <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in particular on the absolute values of these parameters, must be taken into account when comparing parametric MRI data with other quantitative measures of blood (or even tissue) oxygenation. For this reason it is conceptually appealing for future studies to combining invasive techniques and non-invasive MRI in a hybrid setup with the goal to calibrate, monitor and interpret parametric MR and physiological parameters by means of standardized interventions. Absolute values of baseline renal R<sub>2</sub>* were found to be lower in the inner medulla versus outer medulla and cortex, which is in agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Rognant1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Ries1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-dosSantos1">[25]</xref>. This finding does not correspond with tissue pO<sub>2</sub> levels measured by invasive methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Schurek1">[26]</xref>, which showed the lowest pO<sub>2</sub> levels in the inner medulla. One reason behind what seems to be a discrepancy is that the blood oxygenation dependence of R<sub>2</sub>* (T<sub>2</sub>*) does not relate to the deoxyhemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin ratio, but to the absolute amount of deoxyhemoglobin per tissue volume. Thus, besides being dependent on blood oxygenation, R<sub>2</sub>* (T<sub>2</sub>*) is influenced by the blood vessel volume fraction and the hematocrit. Both, vessel volume fraction and hematocrit are low in the inner medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Moffat1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Zimmerhackl1">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In our study complete occlusion of the renal artery and vein were confirmed by MR angiography, rendering potentially confounding changes in global renal blood volume unlikely.

A significant drop in pH during renal artery occlusion in rats has been reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Terrier2">[22]</xref>. By altering the hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve a pH reduction significantly influences the blood oxygenation effect on T<sub>2</sub>* <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Prasad1">[14]</xref>.

Parametric MRI indicated a strong persistent hypoxia in the outer medulla during reperfusion. The outer medulla is particularly susceptible to an ischemic insult due to high cellular metabolic rate (S3 segment of the proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs of Henle&#x02019;s loop) is high and marked hypoperfusion and congestion persist during reperfusion, i.e. in the extension phase of AKI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Sharfuddin1">[30]</xref>. The R<sub>2</sub>* effects of hyperoxia on renal oxygenation were much smaller compared to hypoxia, which might be due to the already high arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin during normoxia. The amount of oxygen not bound to hemoglobin but dissolved in blood, which is expected to increase during hyperoxia, contributes only a rather small fraction to the overall oxygen supply.</p><p>Interleaved mapping of T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> may provide complementary information about the (patho)physiological conditions in the kidney as both MR parameters are affected by changes in blood oxygenation and water content to different degrees. Variations in the volume fraction of deoxygenated hemoglobin impact on the MR signal stemming from intra-vascular spaces of large vessels or capillaries as well as regions around these vessels. These intra- and extra-vascular signal components contribute differently to T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Reeder1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Uludag1">[32]</xref> and T<sub>2</sub> is sensitive to water content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057411-Marinelli1">[33]</xref>. Hence mapping of both parameters could allow for a more comprehensive assessment of renal oxygenation changes. The strong T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub>, changes observed in this study will inspire further explorations into MR methodology suitable for simultaneous T<sub>2</sub>*/T<sub>2</sub> mapping.</p><p>In conclusion, continuous parametric MR monitoring of T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2</sub> throughout an I/R experiment in rats is feasible and provides a temporal resolution of approximately 80&#x02013;100 seconds for each read-out resulting in 3 minutes for alternating T<sub>2</sub>*/T<sub>2</sub> measurements. The proposed MRI approach enables the detailed assessment of <italic>in vivo</italic> changes in all kidney regions during ischemia and early reperfusion. Observations in the early reperfusion phase promise to offer new insights into the pathogenesis of ischemia induced AKI and might help to identify the timeline of key events responsible for development of hypoperfusion-induced renal damage. The established method of parametric MR monitoring holds the promise to be a useful investigational tool for other models of AKI such as x-ray contrast agent induced AKI, rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, or sepsis-induced AKI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057411.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>55 T<sub>2</sub>* parameter maps of an entire ischemia reperfusion experiment.</bold> First row: After a baseline of 6 time points ischemia started at time point 7.
