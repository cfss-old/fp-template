MTT, transwell chamber, and Western blot assays were used to assess the effect of miR-32 on proliferation, EMT, and metastasis of NSCLC cells, respectively. Target prediction and luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the targets of miR-32.

Eligible samples were obtained from the patients with primary NSCLC who had not received any preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In addition, there were no coexisting diseases in these patients. This study and the use of human cell lines were performed with the approval of the Medical Ethical Committee of Huaihe Hospital of Henan University and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All tissue samples were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after resection and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and cell transfection</title><p>Two NSCLC cell lines, H1299 and A549, and human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Cell transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues or cultured cells using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s suggestions. miR-32 expression was determined using TaqMan miRNA assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol, and U6 small nuclear RNA (GeneCopoeia, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as endogenous control. The expression of TWIST1 was determined using SYBR green qPCR assay (Takara, Dalian, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) and normalized with GAPDH (GeneCopoeia).</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>Cell suspensions (2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured overnight in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell growth was monitored every day for a period of 4 days. Briefly, 20 &#x003bc;L of MTT (5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and further incubated for 4 hours. Then, the culture medium in the wells was removed, and 150 &#x003bc;L of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added to dissolve the MTT&#x02013;formazan crystals. The absorbance of each well was read by a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 570 nm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Tissue samples were ground to powder in liquid nitrogen. Total proteins were extracted from tissue powder or treated cells using sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, and an equal amount of protein was separated using 10% polyacrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Then, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were probed with primary antibodies against E-cadherin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vimentin (GeneTex, San Antonio, TX, USA), TWIST1 (Abcam), N-cadherin (GeneTex), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (Abcam), MMP-9 (Abcam), or GAPDH (Gene-Tex). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (Abcam), and detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce ECL Substrate Western blot detection system; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantity One 4.5.0 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) was used to quantify the integrated density of the protein bands.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell migration and invasion assays</title><p>Transwell chambers (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) with a pore size of 8 &#x003bc;m were used for migration and invasion assays. Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free medium. For migration assay, 5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells in serum-free medium were directly added into the upper chamber. For invasion assay, Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was coated on the upper surface of the transwell chamber before use, and then 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells in serum-free medium were added into the upper chamber. RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added into the bottom chamber and served as a chemoattractant. After incubation for 18 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were wiped out with cotton swab. The cells that migrated or invaded to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with hematoxylin, and counted (five high-power fields per chamber) under a microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescent reporter assay</title><p>Wild-type 3&#x02032;UTRs of TWIST1 containing predicted miR-32 target sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from H1299 cell genomic DNA, and mutant 3&#x02032;UTRs were obtained by overlap extension PCR method. H1299 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The transfection mixtures contained 5 pmol of miR-32 and 100 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, and pRL-TK (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, USA) was also transfected as normalization control. Cells were collected 48 hours posttransfection, and the luciferase activity was determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corporation).</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo tumor xenograft model</title><p>Twelve healthy female BALB/c nude mice with 4&#x02013;5 weeks of age were purchased from the Center of Experimental Animal Huaihe Hospital of Henan University. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huaihe Hospital of Henan University. Twelve nude mice were randomized into two groups (ie, control group and miR-32 group). H1299 cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells in 200 &#x003bc;L phosphate-buffered saline) transfected with miR-32 mimics or NC mimics were subcutaneously inoculated into the right dorsal flank of nude mice. The tumor size was measured weekly with slide caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated as follows: tumor volume = length &#x000d7; width<sup>2</sup>/2. Four weeks later, all tested nude mice were euthanized, and tumors were excised and weighed. Moreover, the expression levels of TWIST1, MMP-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin proteins in xenografts were determined by Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-9-1489">Figure 2C and D</xref>, both H1299 and A549 cells transfected with miR-32 mimics had marked decreases in the proliferation rate compared with the control groups, which indicated that miR-32 represses NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro. EMT, characteristic with the loss of epithelial marker E-cadherin and the gain of mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin, has been identified to be one of the major molecular mechanisms inducing cancer metastasis. To investigate whether miR-32 affects the EMT of NSCLC cells, H1299 and A549 cells transfected with miR-32 mimics or NC mimics were used to perform Western blot assay to examine the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin proteins. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-9-1489">Figure 2E and F</xref>, ectopic transfection of miR-32 mimics led to a remarkable increase in E-cadherin expression and obvious decreases in vimentin and N-cadherin expression in H1299 and A549 cells, which indicated that miR-32 suppresses NSCLC cell EMT in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-32 suppresses NSCLC cell metastasis in vitro</title><p>To investigate whether miR-32 affects NSCLC cell metastasis, H1299 and A549 cells were transfected with miR-32 mimics or NC mimics and then were used to perform invasion and migration assays by transwell method. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-9-1489">Figure 3A and B</xref>, the invasion ability of H1299 and A549 cells transfected with miR-32 mimics was significantly reduced compared to the cells transfected with NC mimics. Furthermore, the expression levels of markers of tumor invasion MMP-2 and MMP-9 in H1299 and A549 cells transfected with miR-32 mimics were both lower than those in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-9-1489">Figure 3C and D</xref>). These results indicated that miR-32 suppresses NSCLC cell invasion. Consistently, overexpression of miR-32 led to diminished migratory abilities in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-9-1489">Figure 3E and F</xref>). These observations indicated that miR-32 suppresses NSCLC cell metastasis by impeding cell invasion and migration in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>TWIST1 is a direct target of miR-32</title><p>To further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which miR-32 represses NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis, we used three bioinformatic algorithms (TargetsScan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.org">microrna.org</ext-link>, and miRanda) to screen the target gene of miR-32 and selected TWIST1 for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4A</xref>). To identify whether TWIST1 is regulated by miR-32 via direct binding to its 3&#x02032;UTR, luciferase reporter assays were carried out in H1299 cells. The results showed that cotransfection with miR-32 mimics obviously reduced the luciferase activity of the wild-type reporter gene. This suppressive effect was abolished by mutation of the miR-32 target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4B</xref>). This result suggested that TWIST1 is indeed a direct target of miR-32. Moreover, to confirm the regulatory effect of miR-32 on TWIST1, qRT-PCR and Western blot assays were carried out. The results showed that upregulation of miR-32 resulted in a remarkable decrease in TWIST1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Relatively, downregulation of miR-32 led to obvious increases in TWIST1 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4C and D</xref>). These results indicated that the expression of TWIST1 at both mRNA and protein levels is regulated by miR-32 in vitro. To further confirm whether miR-32 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis by downregulating TWIST1, we transfected H1299 cells with TWIST1 siRNAs (siTWIST1) to silence the expression of TWIST1, and the transfection efficiency was determined by Western blot. Results showed that H1299 cells transfected with siTWIST1 had obvious decrease in TWIST1 expression compared with the cells transfected with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4H</xref>). Then MTT, invasion, migration, and Western blot assays were performed on H1299 cells transfected with siTWIST1 or control. MTT assay showed that transfection with TWIST1 siRNAs resulted in the dramatic decrease in the proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4E</xref>). Invasion and migration assays showed that in the siTWIST1 group, the number of invaded and migrated cells both significantly reduced compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that transfection with TWIST1 siRNAs led to remarkable decreases in MMP-2, MMP-9, vimentin, and N-cadherin expression and a significant increase in E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-9-1489">Figure 4H</xref>). These results indicated that silencing of TWIST1 suppresses H1299 cell proliferation, metastasis, and EMT. Similar effect of siTWIST1 was observed in miR-32 mimics-treated cells, suggesting that siTWIST1 could mimic the effect of miR-32. Taken together, these results suggested that TWIST1 is one of the direct targets of miR-32, and the functional effect of miR-32 on NSCLC cell lines, at least in part, depends on TWIST1.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of miR-32 suppresses growth of NSCLC tumors in vivo</title><p>In vitro studies indicated that miR-32 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis by targeting TWIST1.

Zhu et al<xref rid="b27-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported that silencing of TWIST1 by RNAi downregulates MDR1/P-gp expression in HeLa cervical cancer cells and suppresses the cell proliferation. Zhao et al<xref rid="b28-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> reported that cytoplasmic p27 promotes EMT and tumor progression via TWIST1 upregulation. Croset et al<xref rid="b24-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> reported that TWIST1 expression in breast cancer cells facilitates bone metastasis formation. Depletion of TWIST1 expression represses prostate carcinoma cell and mammary carcinoma cell migration.<xref rid="b29-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition, TWIST1 can also enhance gastric cancer cell invasion and migration both in vitro and in vivo.<xref rid="b31-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For the role of TWIST1 in NSCLC, Hung et al<xref rid="b32-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> reported that TWIST1 is upregulated and is a significant prognostic predictor in patients with NSCLC. Yochum et al<xref rid="b33-ott-9-1489" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> reported that TWIST1 is required for repression of apoptosis in oncogene-driven NSCLC. The earlier findings are the reason why we selected TWIST1 for further analysis. We performed luciferase assay and confirmed that miR-32 targeted TWIST1 directly. The expression of TWIST1 at both mRNA and protein levels was regulated by miR-32, and knockdown of TWIST1 by siRNA reversed NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis. These findings implied that miR-32 suppresses TWIST1 protein expression by directly binding on the 3&#x02032;UTR of TWIST1 mRNA to negatively regulate NSCLC cell proliferation, metastasis, and EMT. Furthermore, in vivo study also confirmed that overexpression of miR-32 suppressed the growth of NSCLC tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results demonstrate the following: miR-32 is downregulated in NSCLC; miR-32 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis; miR-32 directly inhibits TWIST1 expression by targeting its 3&#x02032;UTR; TWIST1 is inversely correlated with miR-32 level in NSCLC; and knockdown of TWIST1 reverses NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis. Our data suggest that miR-32 is an important tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and miR-32/TWIST1 pathway that we studied might be exploited by a therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment in future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
