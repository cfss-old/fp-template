The lesion tolerance processes, which allow damaged DNA to be replicated, entail two branches, error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) and error-free damage avoidance (DA). While TLS pathways are reasonably well established, DA pathways are poorly understood. The fate of a replication-blocking lesion is generally explored by means of plasmid-based assays. Although such assays represent efficient tools to analyse TLS, we show here that plasmid-borne lesions are inappropriate models to study DA pathways due to extensive replication fork uncoupling. This observation prompted us to develop a method to graft, site-specifically, a single lesion in the genome of a living cell. With this novel assay, we show that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DA events massively outweigh TLS events and that in contrast to plasmid, chromosome-borne lesions partially require RecA for tolerance.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Replication of damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a universal problem faced by all organisms. DNA lesions arise continuously due to endogenous or environmental agents. Despite the efficient action of numerous repair systems, some lesions that escape these repair mechanisms are present when the genome is being replicated. To overcome the challenge of replicating damaged DNA, cells have developed several lesion tolerance mechanisms that enable the replication machinery to bypass sites of damaged DNA. The conceptually simplest procedure of bypassing lesions encountered during DNA replication is translesion synthesis (TLS), whereby the replicative polymerase is replaced by a specialized polymerase that can synthesize the new DNA strand across the site of damage. This process, although not always mutagenic, is inherently error-prone [for a review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B1">1</xref>)]. On the other hand, error-free bypass of DNA lesions is possible by using the information present in the undamaged sister chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B2 gks675-B3 gks675-B4 gks675-B5 gks675-B6">2&#x02013;6</xref>). These processes, collectively referred as damage avoidance (DA), embrace several pathways related to homologous recombination and are still poorly defined to date. Failure to achieve TLS or DA will lead to incomplete replication of the genome and therefore to the cell death.</p><p>Until today, studies on the consequences of lesions in DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> are usually limited to the analysis of induced mutations. Indeed, mutations that result from TLS events represent the major biological consequence of the presence of lesions in DNA because DA events are considered to be error-free. However, the respective proportion of TLS versus DA events within DNA damage tolerance events is presently not known. Moreover, most induced-mutagenesis studies involve treatment of cells with damaging agents that introduce a variety of different lesions randomly distributed all over the genome. Consequently, the DNA lesion that causes a given mutation can only be guessed. Over the past recent years, many studies aimed at uncovering the mechanism of TLS by introducing single site-specific lesions within plasmids. This approach has been instrumental to unravel the complexity of TLS pathways and the genetics of mutagenesis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and recently in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B7 gks675-B8 gks675-B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). In the present paper, we show that, during plasmid replication, a single blocking lesion triggers replication fork uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B10">10</xref>) accompanied by full unwinding of the two sister chromatids. As DA events require the two sisters to be maintained in close proximity, plasmid systems are not suited for the analysis of DA events. To overcome the limitations inherent to plasmids, we developed a methodology that allows single lesions to be site-specifically introduced into the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. Under these assay conditions we show that, in contrast to plasmid-borne lesions, tolerance of chromosomal DNA lesions by DA is partially dependent on a functional <italic>recA</italic> gene. Until now, it was essentially impossible to monitor the rescue of a blocked replication fork <italic>in vivo</italic> by lack of an appropriate methodology. Indeed, current assays involve lesions randomly distributed over the chromosome, making it impossible to determine the structure and the dynamic of a fork blocked at a specific lesion site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids construction</title><p>pVP135 expresses the integrase and excisionase (int&#x02013;xis) genes from lambda under control of a trc promoter that has been weakened by mutations in the &#x02212;35 and the &#x02212;10 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B11">11</xref>).

The relative integration efficiencies of damaged vectors compared with their non-damaged homologues, and normalized by the transformation efficiency of pVP146 plasmid in the same electroporation experiment, allow the overall rate of tolerance of the lesion to be measured. DA events are estimated by subtracting TLS events from the total lesion tolerance events.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Evidence for strand uncoupling during replication of a plasmid containing a single replication-blocking lesion</title><p>We developed an assay to analyse the products that are generated during replication of a plasmid vector that contains a single replication-blocking lesion. For this purpose, we used an adduct formed by covalent binding of the chemical carcinogen <italic>N</italic>-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) to the C-8 position of guanine (G-AAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B18">18</xref>). This adduct blocks replication similarly to the ultraviolet (UV)-induced lesions such as TT-CPDs or 6-4 photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B19">19</xref>). The plasmid construct also contains a short sequence heterology in the complementary strand across from the single adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B18">18</xref>). The lesion is located in the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene such that TLS events give rise to lac+ plasmids, while the complementary strand is out of frame and thus gives rise to lac&#x02212; plasmids. These constructs are transformed into a recipient cell (primary transformation) and plated on X-gal indicator plates to identify colonies that have experienced TLS (TLS colonies) as blue colonies (<italic>lacZ</italic>+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Individual &#x02018;TLS colonies&#x02019; are further analysed to determine the average proportion of blue and white plasmids within the cells by extracting plasmid DNA and retransforming it into an indicator strain to determine the proportion of white and blue plasmids (secondary transformation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). When a lesion-free construct is analysed, essentially all primary transformants are blue because the blue phenotype is dominant. Analysis of the plasmid content of individual blue colonies by secondary transformation shows that, as expected, the progeny of the two strands are about equally represented in the majority of colonies analysed (although there is a slight, as yet unexplained, bias towards &#x0003c;50% of blue colonies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). When a construct that monitors TLS events across a single G-AAF adduct is introduced in a non-SOS induced WT strain, only 2&#x02013;3% of colonies are blue (TLS colonies) in the primary transformation, showing that TLS across G-AAF is a rare event. Analysis of individual blue colonies shows that most &#x02018;TLS colonies&#x02019; contain &#x0003c;20% of blue plasmids (and thus &#x0003e;80% white plasmids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The same distribution is seen whether the lesion is located in the leading or in the lagging strand. These results illustrate the &#x02018;replisome uncoupling&#x02019; phenomenon as initially identified by molecular analysis of replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B10">10</xref>). It was concluded from these experiments that when a replisome encounters a replication-blocking lesion, synthesis in the lesion strand is transiently arrested, whereas replication of the undamaged strand continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). It is estimated that following a leading strand block the replicative helicase can unwind the parental strands beyond the blocking lesion over a distance of at least 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B10">10</xref>). Therefore, the commonly used single-adducted plasmid constructs become fully unwound leading to unbalanced amplification of the non-damaged strand with respect to the damaged strand. Replication of the damaged strand lags behind due to the time required to perform TLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F1">Figure 1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B10">10</xref>).

The experimental system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F2">Figure 2</xref>A), based on phage lambda site-specific recombination, entails the following two major components: a recipient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain with a single <italic>attR</italic> site and a non-replicating plasmid construct containing the single lesion of interest and an <italic>attL</italic> site and an ampicillin resistance gene. The recombination reaction between attL and attR is controlled by ectopic expression of phage lambda int&#x02013;xis proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B12">12</xref>), and leads to the integration of the lesion-containing vector into the chromosome. Integrants are selected on the basis of their resistance to ampicillin. The chromosomal integration region carries the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene fused to <italic>attR</italic>, whereas the remaining 5&#x02032;-end is located on the incoming fragment in fusion with <italic>attL</italic>, so that precise integration restores a functional &#x000df;-galactosidase gene (<italic>lacZ</italic>). The non-damaged opposite strand contains a short sequence heterology that inactivates the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene and serves as a genetic marker that allows strand discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B22">22</xref>). Precise integration of the vector at nucleotide resolution was shown by the presence of only LacZ+ colonies following the integration of a lesion-free construct. Individual integration events were analysed by PCR and found to be precisely located at the expected chromosomal position. The present experimental approach allows a single replication-blocking lesion to be located in the leading strand template at min 17. The way this block is tolerated either by TLS or via DA pathways can thus be studied genetically and at the molecular level.

Also, the recipient strain carried mutations in mismatch repair (<italic>mutS</italic>) to prevent correction of the heteroduplex. To assess normal chromosomal strand segregation we first integrated into the chromosome a lesion-free heteroduplex in which one strand carries a <italic>lacZ</italic>+ allele and the other strand a <italic>lacZ</italic>&#x02212; allele. Selection of individual integration events on lac indicator plates (X-gal plates) shows mostly blue:white sectored colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This is expected because chromosomal replication is semi-conservative and daughter chromosomes segregate in a one to one ratio. Molecular analysis of the sectored colonies reveals that blue and white sectors contain the bacterial progeny that stems from the replication and subsequent segregation of the <italic>lac</italic>+ and <italic>lac</italic>&#x02212; strands, respectively. Occasional non-sectored colonies are observed probably reflecting a low extent of heteroduplex correction before replication despite inactivation of mismatch repair.</p><p>Next, we integrated a lac+/lac&#x02212; heteroduplex containing a single G-AAF adduct in the lac+ strand. A majority of integration events form non-sectored pure white colonies on the X-gal indicator plate. Molecular analysis of these events suggests that they result from the processing of the single adduct via a DA pathway. Indeed, these colonies only contain the specific lac&#x02212; allele carried in the non-damaged strand in the initial construct. However, it is presently not possible to eliminate the possibility that the damaged strand is degraded and that some white colonies originate from the sole replication of the non-damaged strand. A small amount of colonies are sectored blue:white colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Molecular analysis of the sectored colonies reveals that the blue and white sectors contain the bacterial progeny that stems from the replication and subsequent segregation of the damaged and undamaged strands, respectively. The blue sectors contain the sequence of the lesion-containing strand and thus represent TLS events. The white sectors carry the lac&#x02212; allele initially present in the complementary strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation illustrates &#x02018;coupled replication&#x02019; of both strands even in the presence of a replication-blocking lesion in contrast to the situation of strand uncoupling encountered with plasmid probes (see previous text). These observations fully validate the use of the present system to study the different lesion tolerance pathways including the yet to be defined DA pathways.
<fig id="gks675-F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Molecular characterization of blue and white sectors taken from lesion-containing sectored colonies. The sequence around the G-AAF adduct site shows the local heteroduplex that allows strand discrimination following replication. The non-damaged strand carries a 3&#x02009;nt insertion that will generate an additional NlaIII restriction site during replication. Two PCR primers were designed to amplify a 610-bp fragment around the lesion site. The figure represents the analysis of individual sectors from seven sectored clones resulting from the integration of an AAF damaged vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Analysis of the white sectors (bottom gel) by NlaIII digestion shows the presence of an additional NlaIII restriction site corresponding to the replication of the non-damaged strand of the chromosome. Analysis of the blue sectors (top gel) lacks the additional NlaIII site; sequencing of these PCR fragments showed the expected sequence resulting from TLS events on the damaged strand (i.e. frameshift-2 in the NarI hotspot where the lesion is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B23">23</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks675f3"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>DA events require the function of recA</title><p>DA pathways are defined as representing the error-free branch of post recombinational repair. It is supposed that replication-blocking lesions are non-informative and that the missing information is accurately retrieved from the sister chromatid by means of mechanisms akin to homologous recombination. Consequently, we wanted to investigate the tolerance of single chromosomal lesions in <italic>recA</italic><italic>&#x02212;</italic> and <italic>recA</italic>+ strains. For this purpose, we compared three common replication blocking lesions, namely G-AAF and the two major UV-induced photoproducts, the TT-CPD and the TT(6-4). In a <italic>recA</italic>+ strain, there is no detectable loss in the integration efficiency of any of these lesions relative to the respective lesion-free construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, in a <italic>recA</italic><italic>&#x02212;</italic>deficient strain, the relative integration efficiency, hereafter referred to as the &#x02018;survival&#x02019;, dropped to about 40&#x02013;50% for all three lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This loss in survival reflects a severe impairment to process a single lesion by DA in the absence of RecA protein. Although the involvement of RecA or its homologues in DA was expected from existing models of DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B25">25</xref>), the present results offer, for the first time, an experimental quantification of the phenomenon at the level of a single chromosomal lesion. Meanwhile, the results also suggest the existence of a <italic>recA</italic>-independent DA pathway that accounts for &#x0223c;50% of the lesion tolerance events. Classical models of DA entail either template switching at regressed forks or daughter strand gap formation that are subsequently filled in by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B26">26</xref>). It is likely that the <italic>recA</italic>-dependent DA pathway corresponds to the classical daughter strand gap-filling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B27">27</xref>), whereas the <italic>recA</italic>-independent component may relate to DA via template switching. It should be stressed that under our conditions, where SOS is not induced, TLS events represent a minor fraction (0.5&#x02013;3%) with respect to DA events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Moreover, the small amount of TLS events is further suppressed in the <italic>recA</italic><italic>&#x02212;</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks675-F4">Figure 4</xref>A) because Pol V requires RecA for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B29">29</xref>).

As discussed earlier, damaged plasmid replication exhibits uncoupled amplification of the two strands, a process that appears not to be impeded in a <italic>recA</italic><italic>&#x02212;</italic> strain in contrast to the observation made for the chromosome-borne lesions. This observation reinforces the notion that plasmids are not suitable tools for the analysis of genuine DA events as discussed in the previous section.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present work provides the first experimental system to study TLS and DA pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a quantitative manner. Depending on the nature of the replication block, tolerance pathways occur either directly at the fork (on the fly) or at gaps left opposite lesion, i.e. behind the fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B26">26</xref>). Indeed, when encountering a strong replication block in the leading strand, the fork can restart by means of a priming event that occurs downstream of the lesion, leaving a gap that is subsequently processed by TLS or DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B32">32</xref>). We show that for common replication-blocking lesions, such as UV-induced photoproducts or G-AAF adducts, DA events massively outweigh TLS events (97% versus 1&#x02013;3%) in non-SOS induced cells. The present methodology opens new ways to explore the metabolism of defined replication fork blocks at the chromosomal level. We highlight a major drawback of plasmid-borne lesion assays by showing that the extensive uncoupling between sister chromatids that occurs during plasmid replication precludes DA events to be monitored. This point is illustrated by the fact that, in contrast to plasmid-borne lesions, tolerance of chromosomal DNA lesions by DA is partially dependent on a functional <italic>recA</italic> gene. Until now, it was essentially impossible to monitor the repair of blocked replication forks <italic>in vivo</italic> by lack of an appropriate methodology.</p><p>This approach offers an experimental system able to open up the field of replication fork recovery in a way comparable with the development of double-strand break repair by the introduction of single double-strand breaks by HO and I-SceI endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks675-B34">34</xref>). In the present article, lesion tolerance pathways have been monitored using only genetic read-outs. However, given the efficiency of integration, i.e. 5&#x02013;10% of all cells, we intend to develop molecular methods able to detect early replication intermediates that should allow us to monitor replication fork rescue in real time.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>LIGUE Contre le Cancer</funding-source> (labellization 2011, in part); <funding-source>ANR grant ForkRepair</funding-source> [<award-id>ANR 11 BSV8 017 01</award-id>, in part]; fellowship from the <funding-source>Fondation ARC pour la recherche sur le cancer</funding-source> (to V.P. and K.N., in part).
