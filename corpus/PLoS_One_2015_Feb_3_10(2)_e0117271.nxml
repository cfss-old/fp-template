It is suggested that early enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) leads to better outcomes, although many patients are diagnosed late and don&#x02019;t receive immediate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the effects of late onset ERT in a MPS I murine model. MPS I mice received treatment from 6 to 8 months of age (ERT 6&#x02013;8mo) with 1.2mg laronidase/kg every 2 weeks and were compared to 8 months-old wild-type (Normal) and untreated animals (MPS I). ERT was effective in reducing urinary and visceral GAG to normal levels. Heart GAG levels and left ventricular (LV) shortening fraction were normalized but cardiac function was not completely improved. While no significant improvements were found on aortic wall width, treatment was able to significantly reduce heart valves thickening. High variability was found in behavior tests, with treated animals presenting intermediate results between normal and affected mice, without correlation with cerebral cortex GAG levels. Cathepsin D activity in cerebral cortex also did not correlate with behavior heterogeneity. All treated animals developed anti-laronidase antibodies but no correlation was found with any parameters analyzed. However, intermediary results from locomotion parameters analyzed are in accordance with intermediary levels of heart function, cathepsin D, activated glia and reduction of TNF-&#x003b1; expression in the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, even if started late, ERT can have beneficial effects on many aspects of the disease and should be considered whenever possible.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Fundo de Incentivo &#x000e0; Pesquisa e Eventos do Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (FIPE-HCPA) and Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES), Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)/ Minist&#x000e9;rio da Sa&#x000fa;de (MS)/ Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq)/ Secretaria de Estado da Sa&#x000fa;de do RS (process #1151-2551/13-3).

Its deficiency leads to progressive accumulation of undegraded or partially degraded substrate within lysosomes, with subsequent multiorgan dysfunction and damage [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is a considerable clinical variability in the age of onset and rate of disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, three classical phenotypes are usually considered: severe Hurler (OMIM #67014), intermediary Hurler Scheie (OMIM #607015) and the attenuated Scheie syndrome (OMIM # 67016) [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The Hurler form corresponds to 50&#x02013;80% of known cases [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It shares many systemic manifestations that are found in the attenuated forms, such as growth retardation hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, heart disease and respiratory insufficiency. However, it is rapidly progressive, presents progressive neurodegeneration and death usually occurs during the first decade of life [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Two treatment options are available for MPS I: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). HSCT is the treatment of choice for Hurler patients and when performed before cognitive impairment begins, it can significantly preserve intellectual development [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Nonetheless, data from the MPS I Registry show that Hurler patients from Latin America are diagnosed at a later age than the rest of the world and that there is an average delay of 1.9 to 3.1 years between median age of diagnosis and the median age of first treatment for Hurler patients [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A study done by Vieira et al. (2008) which collected data solely from Brazilian MPS patients showed a great delay in diagnosis, when compared to other reports from the literature: 30 to 75 months. It is important to point out that due to the nature of the public health system in Brazil, medical appointments, particularly with specialists, can take months to be scheduled. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge of Brazilian health professionals about MPS [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another important issue is the shortage of specialists to meet the demand of the population. Currently, there are 172 registered professionals in the Brazilian Society of Medical Genetics, from which 82 are located in S&#x000e3;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, to attend a population of approximately 191 millions of habitants spread across 8.5 billions of km<sup>2</sup> (data from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics&#x02014;IBGE). In addition to delayed diagnosis, the access to the medication is also very problematic. Consequently most patients are already older than indicated to undergoing HSCT and to achieve maximal benefits from ERT. Even so, ERT has become the most used treatment in Brazil and other Latin American countries [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore we analyzed effects of ERT in adult MPS mice, when symptoms are well established.</p><p>Urinary GAG levels in the ERT 6&#x02013;8mo group were normalized as soon as the second injection and maintained low levels throughout the treatment. In untreated animals there was an expressive increase in GAG levels when compared to previous reports of 6 months MPS animals [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is important to stress that total urinary GAG may not reflect major clinical signs and symptoms and GAG content in urine is thought to reflect primarily storage in renal tubular epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consistently whit this observation, kidney storage was higher than previously reported as well [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, ERT started late was also able to normalize storage in other visceral organs as liver and lungs. Weight evaluation showed no statistically significant improvement after treatment (data not shown), which is in accordance to what has been shown previously by our group in animals treated from 2 to 6 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Cardiac manifestations are common in MPS I patients and worsen with age [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Heart GAG level presented an 8-fold increase in MPS mice. It was significantly reduced to normal levels in the ERT 6&#x02013;8mo group. However, this reduction was not completely translated into a better heart function. The LV shortening fraction was normalized and there was also an improvement in the LV ejection fraction, which indicates an enhancement in myocardial contractility. The AT/ET ratio reflects pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension. It was only partly corrected after treatment, suggesting that this aspect of the disease might be harder to correct and/or needs a longer treatment length. In previous experiments, all three parameters could be normalized by ERT administrated with the same dose and periodicity started either in the neo-natal period or from 2 to 6 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, our data suggest that this dose regimen is able to prevent but not to completely reverse heart disease in the mouse model of MPS I (<xref rid="pone.0117271.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A report from Gabrielli et al. (2010) on two siblings with attenuated MPS I held similar results. The younger brother, treated from 5 months had no cardiac disease before or after 5 year of laronidase treatment. The older sister treatment&#x02019;s began at 5 years of age, when she already presented pulmonary hypertension. Five years later, her heart disease was not improved but stabilized.</p><p>The most prominent cardiac manifestation in MPS I is valvular abnormality [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although usually not fatal, it may contribute to clinical disease [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore we also evaluated heart valves thickening and aortic wall width. In this study, ERT started late had no significant results on aortic width. On the other hand, heart valves in the ERT 6&#x02013;8mo were about half the size when compared to untreated animals and had no statistical difference from the normal group. Similar results were reported in the canine model. Animals treated weekly with 1.57mg/kg from birth showed valves similar to normal animals and mice treated with 0.58mg/kg still had some residual storage [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. When adult animals where treated, only the ones with induced immune-tolerance to IDUA had improvement in the valves [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our data, no correlation between immune status and valve thickening was found (data not shown). In addition, studies in humans showed that ERT has no or only minor effects in aortic width and valve thickness once it is established [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HSCT also has no effect on cardiac valvular thickening progress in some patients [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In the usual dose, the infused enzyme is not expected to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) at therapeutic levels [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is the reason why ERT isn&#x02019;t indicated for neurological manifestations of Hurler patients. Therefore, data on cognitive analysis from Hurler patients after ERT is very scarce. Wraith et al. (2007) reported that Hurler patients treated from less than 2.5 years of age showed mental development similar to normal children, whereas older patients showed no improvement. Tokic et al. (2007) reported that two patients had no improvement in mental state but positive changes were observed in humor and behavior. Similar results are found with HSCT, as cerebral damage present before transplantation seems to be irreversible [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, evidence from animal studies is challenging this idea, suggesting that at least some enzyme is able to cross the BBB [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A study with the murine metachromatic leukodystrophy model evaluated ERT effects on presymptomatic, early and progressed stages of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. ERT efficacy was shown to be age-related, with improvement in behavioral alterations seen only with early treatment. Previous data from our group suggest that early (starting neonatal or at two months) administration of ERT seems effective in preventing or normalizing brain disease in MPS I mice [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The animals treated in the present study were adults with well-established cognitive impairment. Therefore, no positive changes on neurologic and musculoskeletal functions were expected. Still the high heterogeneity found in the open field test was remarkable, with some animals showing signs of improvement. It is strikingly that treated animals clearly can be divided into three groups, one with parameters similar to normal mice, the other intermediate and the last similar to untreated affected animals.</p><p>We then investigated if this apparent group of mice with &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; behavior presented other distinctive characteristics. No reduction was observed in cerebral cortex GAG of treated animals, regardless of open field test results. Cathepsin D, possibly a more accurate biomarker, also did not reflect the observed heterogeneity, since treated animals had intermediary values between normal and untreated mice. Heart function, tissue and urinary GAG levels also showed no relation to open field data (data not shown). Bone and joint improvements could also alter the results for the test. However, a previous report from our group [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found no improvement in joint disease in 6 months old mice neither after neonatal nor adult ERT (2 to 6 months of age). Therefore, we also do not expect improvements after the late treatment applied in this study.</p><p>Neuroinflammation has been reported to play a role in the progression of brain disease in MPS I [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Glia activation, which suggest a neuroinflammatory process, can be normalized with ERT when stared at birth or at 2 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our data shows that ERT even started at a late stage of the disease can reduce this process in cortex since treated animals had significantly less GFAP positive cells than untreated 8 month MPS mice. The expression of cytokines MIP1-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; were also studied. MIP1-&#x003b1; is a chemokine released by glia which attract monocytes into the CNS and has elevated levels on the brain of MPS I mice [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; is an proinflammatory cytokine released by the activated glia that propagates inflammation and its expression is also increased in MPS mice brain [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The reduction of activated glia was only partially reflected by lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in cortex. MIP1-&#x003b1; mRNA levels from treated mice presented a reduction from untreated controls, although it was not statistically significant. However, TNF-&#x003b1; expression was significantly reduced on treated animals indicating a partial improvement on neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, these changes were not correlated to improved behavior in that subset of animals.</p><p>Finally, antibody formation against the enzyme was also investigated as a possible explanation for the behavior results. Almost all patients on clinical trials produce IgG antibodies against laronidase, particularly in the first weeks of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An inverse correlation was found between antibody titer and urinary GAG reduction, however no significant correlation was established with clinical efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Reports from animal models, on the other hand support the idea that antibodies titer decrease the effectiveness of treatment. A study by Dickson et al. (2008) in the canine model showed that immune-tolerized dogs achieved increased tissue enzyme levels in most non reticular tissues and a greater reduction in tissue GAG levels, lysosomal pathology, and urinary GAG excretion when compared to non-tolerized animals. A previous report by our group showed that mice which developed antibodies performed significantly worse in the open field habituation test [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, data presented in this study is not consistent with this hypothesis. Although all treated animals developed antibodies against laronidase, no significant correlations were found between antibody titer and GAG level, behavior tests or cathepsin D activity (data not shown).</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the behavioral results found in this study do not perfectly match the previous ones from our group. Although in both cases animals were placed on the same location and the same parameters were analyzed for the same time, the equipment&#x02019;s used were different. Baldo et al (2012; 2013) utilized a square arena (52 cm &#x000d7; 52 cm) with the floor divided into 16 squares. All measurements were made manually. Here, all measurements were made automatically by the equipment with an area of 50x50cm, divided in 64 squares and 16 sensors in each side. Therefore, in this study, sensitivity for crossings was much higher and the number of events was greater. On the other hand, sensitivity for rearings is higher when counted manually because mice needed to achieve a certain height to be detected by the sensors. Consequently, data from this parameter was lower. Nevertheless, the significant difference found in locomotor and exploratory activities between normal and MPS control mice in this study is in accordance with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117271.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], although with slightly different order of magnitude.</p><p>In addition to that, a more precise analysis of behavioral impact of ERT would have been achieved if animals were tested both at the beginning and at the end of treatment and these values were compared. However, as behavioral outcome was not our main goal, animals were tested only once, at the end of the treatment. Therefore, this high variability which couldn&#x02019;t be explained by GAG cortex levels, cathepsin D, heart function or antibody levels was found in the behavior of treated animals and needs to be further studied. Nonetheless, intermediary results from the three parameters analyzed for locomotion (crossings, distance and velocity) are in accordance with intermediary levels of heart function, cathepsin D, activated glia and reduction of TNF-&#x003b1; on cortex.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge the limitations of working with an animal model to directly transpose conclusions to human beings. The effects seen on open field tests can be altered by improved function of other organs and not exclusively CNS. Also, the enzyme delivery method applied in mice models is different from what is done in patients. The use a bolus injection instead of a long infusion could result in a different biodistribution and better perfusion to the CNS.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that, even if started late, ERT is effective in reducing urinary GAG and storage in visceral organs. Although heart GAG levels were also normalized and valve thickness was greatly reduced, heart function was not completely restored and there was no effect in aortic wall width. However, since cardio-respiratory complications are the main cause of death in Hurler patients, the improvements seen in this study could have important repercussions on patients&#x02019; quality of life. A further discussion on the ethical implications of ERT in severely mentally impaired patients, though, must be conducted but is out of the scope of the present study The introduction of ERT, even later in life, can have beneficial effects on many aspects of the disease and should be considered whenever possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117271.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Control groups: 8 months normal (Idua<sup>+/+</sup> or Idua<sup>+/-</sup>, n = 8) and MPS I (n = 11) mice.
