However, the biological activity of 1-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl &#x003b2;-D-glucoside (CG), a glucose ester derivative of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, has not been clearly examined. The objective of this study is to elucidate the anti-inflammatory action of CG in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. In the present study, CG significantly suppressed LPS-induced excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and PGE<sub>2</sub> and the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2. CG also inhibited LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. In addition, CG significantly suppressed LPS-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B. To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which CG exerts its anti-inflammatory action, involvement of various signaling pathways were examined. CG exhibited significantly increased Akt phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, although MAPKs such as Erk, JNK, and p38 appeared not to be involved. Furthermore, inhibition of Akt/PI3K signaling pathway with wortmannin significantly, albeit not completely, abolished CG-induced Akt phosphorylation and anti-inflammatory actions. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Akt signaling pathway might play a major role in CG-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>1-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl &#x003b2;-D-glucoside (CG)</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>COX-2</kwd><kwd>iNOS</kwd><kwd>Lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>RAW264.7 cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR">Kangwon National University</funding-source><award-id>c1009820-01-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hydroxycinnamic acids have been reported to possess a wide variety of biological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and neuroprotective activities [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We demonstrated that 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid, a derivative of hydroxycinnamic acid, significantly attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses through the suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription and the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in BV2 microglial cells [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, ester derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids have been also reported to exhibit numerous biological properties [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE) inhibits cytokine-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation through the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in macrophage cells [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, we also observed anti-inflammatory activity of methyl <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamate, a methyl ester of hydroxycinnamic acid, in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macroglial cells. Methyl <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamate significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses (Under review). Given the facts that methyl <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamate, a methyl ester of hydroxycinnamic acid, possesses a variety of biological activities such as anti-tumor [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], anti-oxidant [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], depigmenting [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and anti-adipogenic [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] activities, 1-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl &#x003b2;-D-glucose (CG), a glucose ester of hydroxycinnamic acid, has a potential to exhibit biological activities. However, the anti-inflammatory property of CG has not been clearly examined. CG has been reported to be present in berry fruits including strawberries (<italic>Fragaria x ananassa</italic>) [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CG, used in the present study, was isolated from the bark of <italic>Salix hulteni</italic> [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Macrophages play an major role in inflammation and mobilization of the host defense against bacterial infection [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However aberrant activation of macrophages has been also reported to play a pathogenic role in various inflammatory disorders including sepsis [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In pathogenic conditions, abnormally activated macrophages produce excessive amount of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines through NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated pro-inflammatory transcription that eventually aggravates the inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is the most common cause of macrophage activation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. LPS-induced activation of macrophages has been reported to cause a wide range of responses including secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, expression of adhesion molecules and coagulation factors, phagocytosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangement [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, suppression of aberrant activation of macrophage might be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to examine the anti-inflammatory properties of CG and its underlying mechanism in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells in order to provide a valuable pharmacological agent that could attenuate aberrant inflammatory responses in inflammation-related conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p>Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> serotype 055:B5 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 1-<italic>p</italic>-Coumaryol &#x003b2;-D-glucoside (CG) was isolated and identified from the bark of <italic>Salix hulteni</italic> [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the cell culture at the desired concentrations. The macrophage RAW264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco BRL) at 37&#x02103;, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Proteins were transferred to Hypond PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and blocked in 5% skim milk in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature. Specific antibodies against iNOS, COX-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated (p)-ERK, p38, p-p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase Akt, p-Akt (1 : 1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; (1 : 1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc), and &#x003b2;-actin (1 : 2,500; Sigma) were diluted in 5% skim milk.

Therefore, inhibitory property of CG on NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells were examined. RWA264.7 cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of CG for 1 hr prior to LPS treatment and, for NO measurement, Griess reaction was used as an index for NO synthesis.

CG significantly attenuated LPS-induced extracellular release of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CG attenuates LPS-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B</title><p>NF-&#x003ba;B has been widely demonstrated to be a major transcription factor of multiple pro-inflammatory genes. Cytosolic I&#x003ba;B negatively regulates NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated transcription by sequestering NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm given the fact that NF-&#x003ba;B in cytoplasm has to translocate to the nucleus for transcription of pro-inflammatory genes when NF-&#x003ba;B is freed due to proteasomal degradation of I&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Once degradation of I&#x003ba;B In the present study, whether CG inhibits LPS-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B was examined.

Cells were pretreated with CG at indicated concentrations and then were treated with LPS (200 ng/ml) for 30 min. Data showed that no significant changes were observed in the phosphorylation levels of MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, CG significantly resulted in the increased phosphorylation of Akt in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of Akt signaling pathway with wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, significantly abolished the CG-induced Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>), suggesting that activation of Akt/PI3K signaling mediate the anti-inflammatory action of CG. However, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway with wortmannin did not completely recover CG-induced suppression of iNOS and COX-2 expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), suggesting that other signaling pathways rather than Akt/PI3K might be also involved in the anti-inflammatory property of CG.

CG significantly attenuated LPS-induced production of NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> and their protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. In addition, CG showed significant attenuation of LPS-induced I&#x003ba;B degradation and activation of Akt phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.</p><p>CG is a glucose ester of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid. Hydroxycinnamic acids have been reported to possess a variety of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been reported that <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid suppressed cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, we observed that 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid (THC), a derivative of hydroxycinnamic acids, significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses through the activation of a cytoprotective transcription signaling pathway of Nrf2 [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ester derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids have been demonstrated to possess numerous pharmacological activities including antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and neuroprotective activities [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previously, we reported that 1-docosanoyl cafferate (DC), a high molecular fatty alcohol ester of caffeic acid, exhibited a significant anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated murine immortalized microglial cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, methyl p-hydroxycinnamate, a methyl ester derivative of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells (Under review). Although significant amount of coumaric acid derivatives has been identified to be present as glycosides in medicinal plants, biological activity of sugar esters of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid has not been extensively examined [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The present data showed that methyl <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamate exhibited more potent anti-inflammatory action compared with CG. It has been also demonstrated that aglycones of flavonoid glycosides exhibit more potent free radical scavenging activity than their glycosides [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The present and other studies suggest that glycosides exhibit attenuated biological activities presumably with less efficient intracellular uptake due to hydrophilicity of sugar residues. Recently, we observed that avicularin, quercetin-3-&#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranoside, exhibited less potent anti-inflammatory property compared to its aglycone, quercetin, in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Glycosides have been reported to be hydrolyzed to the aglycones by gycosidases in intestines and liver [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and types of sugar moiety determine the bioavailability of glycosides [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to clearly elucidate the effects of a glucose residue of CG on its biological activity and efficiency of intracellular uptake.</p><p>Akt/PI3K signaling pathway has been demonstrated to exert significant anti-inflammatory effects through the suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated transcription [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The present study showed that phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased with CG in a concentration-dependent manner in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. However, increased Akt phosphorylation was not observed with CG in na&#x000ef;ve RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that CG-mediated Akt activation might be LPS stimulation-dependent (data not shown). Further studies are necessary to understand the stimulation-dependent manner of Akt activation by CG. Furthermore, blockade of Akt/PI3K with wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, significantly attenuated CG-induced Akt phosphorylation, indicating that Akt signaling pathway may play an important role in CG-induced anti-inflammatory effects. However, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway with wortmannin did not completely recover the CG-induced suppression of iNOS and COX-2 expression, suggesting that although Akt might play a major role in CG-mediated anti-inflammatory actions, other signaling pathways might be also involved in the anti-inflammatory property of CG. MAPK signaling pathways have been reported to play certain roles in anti-inflammatory mechanism [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, no noticeable changes of MAPKs were not observed in the present study, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of CG presumably be through the activation of Akt, but not MAPK, signaling pathway in the present cell culture model. However, further studies are necessary to delineate the exact mechanism by which CG activates Akt and other signaling pathways.</p><p>Macrophages and monocytes play essential roles in the host defense against bacterial infection [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, aberrantly activated macrophages also play a detrimental role in inflammation-related disorders including sepsis by producing various pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Macrophages initiate LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene transcription when LPS binds to its membrane receptor, TLR4, which leads to the phosphorylation of multiple kinases, which subsequently activates various transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 families [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We previously reported that LPS causes increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and the increased degradation I&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CG significantly attenuated LPS-induced I&#x003ba;B degradation in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, CG significantly attenuated LPS-induced extracellular secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. Although pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and NF-&#x003ba; B-mediated transcription have been reported to play key roles in inflammatory responses, other cytokines and transcription factors might also play a certain role. Therefore, further studies are necessary to clearly explain the effect of CG other cytokines and transcription factors in LPS-mediated inflammatory conditions.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is a key transcription factor for the expression of a variety of pro-inflammatory genes such as iNOS, COX-2, and cytokines [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The aberrant activation of NF-&#x003ba;B has been widely demonstrated to be associated with various pathological conditions including cancers and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In endotoxin-stimulated macrophages, NF-&#x003ba;B translocates to the nucleus for the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes when I&#x003ba;B is phosphorylated with LPS-induced I&#x003ba;B Kinase (IKK) and subsequently degraded through proteasomal pathway [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The present data showed that CG significantly attenuated LPS-induced I&#x003ba;B degradation in a concentration-dependent manner, which is suggestive of subsequent prevention of nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B. We previously observed that inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation eventually retains p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B in cytoplasm [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the present study clearly demonstrates that CG possesses anti-inflammatory property such as suppression of NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> production and cytokine secretion via the inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The anti-inflammatory action of CG is considered to be mediated through the activation of Akt/PI3K signaling pathway. However, further studies are necessary to delineate the exact mechanism by which CG activates Akt/PI3K signaling pathway. The present study strongly suggests that CG might be a valuable therapeutic agent in the treatment of inflammatory pathogenic conditions including sepsis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This work was supported by 2013 research grant from Kangwon National University (Chun,
