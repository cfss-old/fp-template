By adding precipitating ions to cell culture medium containing serum, mineral nanoparticles are generated that are morphologically and chemically identical to the so-called NB. These nanoparticles are shown here to be formed of amorphous mineral complexes containing calcium as well as other ions like carbonate, which then rapidly acquire phosphate, forming HAP. The main constituent proteins of serum-derived NB are albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A1, but their involvement appears circumstantial since so-called NB from different body fluids harbor other proteins. Accordingly, by passage through various culture media, the protein composition of these particles can be modulated. Immunoblotting experiments reveal that antibodies deemed specific for NB react in fact with either albumin, fetuin-A, or both, indicating that previous studies using these reagents may have detected these serum proteins from the same as well as different species, with human tissue nanoparticles presumably absorbing bovine serum antigens from the culture medium. Both fetal bovine serum and human serum, used earlier by other investigators as sources of NB, paradoxically inhibit the formation of these entities, and this inhibition is trypsin-sensitive, indicating a role for proteins in this inhibitory process. Fetuin-A, and to a lesser degree albumin, inhibit nanoparticle formation, an inhibition that is overcome with time, ending with formation of the so-called NB. Together, these data demonstrate that NB are most likely formed by calcium or apatite crystallization inhibitors that are somehow overwhelmed by excess calcium or calcium phosphate found in culture medium or in body fluids, thereby becoming seeds for calcification. The structures described earlier as NB may thus represent remnants and by-products of physiological mechanisms used for calcium homeostasis, a concept which explains the vast body of NB literature as well as explains the true origin of NB as lifeless protein-mineralo entities with questionable role in pathogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="35"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nanobacteria (NB), bacterial entities with unusually small sizes and widespread distribution in animals and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, have been implicated in numerous diseases and as infectious agents associated with body fluids, blood infusion products, and vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

We demonstrate here that the same amorphous mineral complexes composed of simple calcium compounds and well-known proteins, that normally prevent calcium from crystallizing, can also behave as scaffolds for crystallization once the same inhibition is overcome. Accordingly, NB may be molded or morphed by multiple calcium-binding proteins and ions present in the milieu, allowing them to mirror the environment and to vary in composition according to the environmental imprint. We believe that this alternative concept allows for explaining the entire published phenomenology of NB, including their complex protein composition, HAP coating, and pleomorphism. Viewed this way, NB are no more than by-products of the normal, homeostatic mechanisms found in the body and throughout nature designed to deal with excess calcium, phosphate and other ions, and these same mechanisms serve to modulate the final composition of NB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>General strategy and working hypothesis</title><p>The biochemical characterization of NB is hampered by their slow propagation in culture, with doubling times of 3 days or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and a complete lack of understanding of what determines exactly the NB composition. Thus, rather than just using published protocols to study NB as complex and ambiguous entities derived in culture, we also attempted a reverse strategy by first generating well-defined amorphous mineral complexes&#x02014;particles that we have labeled NLP to distinguish them from the published NB. That is, we sought to reconstitute NLP using simple precipitation methods by adding calcium, carbonate, magnesium, and phosphate to various well-defined cell culture media, followed by our demonstration that these NLP are virtually identical to the NB obtained using published protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach can be justified by the fact that all NB cultures to date have originated from the introduction of some exogenous factor(s), be them serum, some other kind of body fluid, or pulverized tissue homogenates, to normal culture media that may very well have perturbed the local equilibrium of calcium, resulting in slow and ambiguous calcium and HAP precipitations that are then described as NB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. By our adding, in a controlled manner, the various ions to exceed their saturation levels, the process of NB formation can be enhanced many fold, resulting in more quantifiable and reproducible observations. This alternative approach allows for the systematic testing and monitoring of a large number of variables relevant to NB formation which otherwise would have been difficult to study. Once the main components of NB were defined through this <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution approach, we were then able to simulate, and even accurately predict, the composition of NB as a result of environmental changes as well as to reconcile our findings with the entire body of published data on NB.</p><p>Central to our hypothesis is the currently accepted notion that extraskeletal bio-mineralization or calcification is thermodynamically favored at concentrations of calcium and phosphate normally found in body fluids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Schinke1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-JahnenDechent1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Boskey1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. That is, with regards to bio-mineralization, given this well-known propensity for calcification under normal conditions, the key challenge appears not so much understanding how calcifications are triggered, but how they are inhibited! In this context, competing ions, like carbonate and magnesium, and calcium-binding proteins, like fetuin-A and albumin, should probably be viewed as calcification inhibitors. However, these same calcification inhibitors, following their initial binding to calcium and/or phosphate, if not disposed, can be overcome eventually by an excess of calcifying ions found in certain body fluids or culture conditions and, as such, they may become constituents of the calcified end-product. According to this alternative concept, the same inhibitors of calcium or apatite crystallization which are deployed physiologically to inhibit calcification may provide a nucleating seed or nidus for NB formation once it is overcome by the presence of calcium and/or phosphate found normally in high concentrations in culture or body fluids. In the final analysis, it is this same calcium or apatite inhibitory complex that provides the semblance of a filterable and transferable infectious agent characterized as NB.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inhibitory effects of serum on NB formation</title><p>To date, the most widely used published procedure for NB formation consists simply of inoculating a source of NB, presumably serum, another body fluid, or a tissue homogenate, into culture medium (usually Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium or DMEM) supplemented with or without added serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We noticed that amounts of FBS exceeding 0.3&#x00025; were generally inhibitory on NB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1A, &#x0201c;FBS&#x0201d; row</xref>) whereas HS was only mildly inhibitory at much higher levels, usually at 3&#x00025; or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1A, &#x0201c;HS&#x0201d; row</xref>). That is, in the case of HS, the amount of precipitates increased slightly with an increase in the amount of serum inoculated into the medium, reaching a plateau or decreasing thereafter with further increases in serum concentration. The exact amount of inhibition appeared to vary with the lot or batch of FBS and HS used, with significant scatter and margin of error, but the dual effects of enhancement of NB growth at low amounts of serum followed by inhibition at higher serum levels appeared to be generally reproducible with all the serum samples tested to date.</p><p>These results were surprising since serum was the first source of NB described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. As demonstrated by these experiments, the difficulty with working with serum alone, resulting in marginally detectable levels of particle precipitation even over a prolonged period of time, reflects the inherent complexities and ambiguities involved. In retrospect, these same ambiguities can easily lead the observer to overlook important observations, as was the case here with serum inhibition, a paradoxical result given the fact that serum had earlier been described as the source of NB that led to their discovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Formation of NLP using simple precipitation procedures</title><p>In order to have a better controlled, biochemical handle on NB-like formations, we next turned to alternative methods for generating NB-like precipitations, which we have called NLP. Using precipitation methods outlined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>, various calcium-containing NLP were obtained in DMEM, in the presence or absence of serum, through the simple addition of calcium, magnesium, carbonate and/or phosphate to concentrations at or exceeding saturation levels (0.3 to 10 mM for calcium, carbonate, and phosphate). The amount of precipitation could be controlled through the amount of precipitating reagents inoculated into DMEM, as seen by visual inspection and turbidity measurement at 650 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). It should be noted that DMEM alone has 1.8 mM calcium, 0.9 mM phosphate, 0.8 mM magnesium, and 44 mM carbonate. The fact that adding only 0.3 mM calcium, carbonate, and phosphate to DMEM could induce precipitation visible to the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1B, &#x0201c;No Serum&#x0201d; row, well 3</xref>) suggests that the DMEM composition must be already close to saturation levels of calcium and phosphate. NLP could also be formed in the presence of serum, illustrated by the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1B (2<sup>nd</sup> row)</xref> that used 1&#x00025; FBS while varying the amount of precipitating ion reagent added. As demonstrated earlier with NB, the addition of this 1&#x00025; FBS was clearly inhibitory on NLP formation, requiring as much as 3 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate to overcome the inhibition (compare visual reading and A<sub>650</sub> data obtained between the various wells of the two rows).</p><p>The NLP precipitates could be sedimented by centrifugation, washed, and transferred to new medium, or allowed to grow in size for various incubation times prior to their transfer. These NLP could be made to vary in ionic composition by simply changing the amounts of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate, as well as serum, added to the precipitation mixture, as demonstrated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In our hands, a wide repertoire of particle compositions could be obtained, ranging from predominantly calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate particles to calcium particles containing carbonate, magnesium, and phosphate in various proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;H</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of NLP and NB.</title><p>EDX results were selected to illustrate the wide spectrum of NLP compositions, with respect to the amounts of calcium and phosphorus incorporated, and their similarities to NB.

By visual inspection, it was obvious that calcium-containing NLP enriched either in carbonate or phosphate differed markedly from each other, with the carbonate-enriched NLP appearing more chalky and granular, and being easier to disperse in aqueous solutions, while the phosphate-enriched NLP appeared gray and gelatinous, and were much harder to disperse. When incubated in medium, the phosphate-enriched NLP grew much faster than the carbonate-NLP, with the latter showing a finer and more granular precipitate than the phosphate-enriched NLP. Furthermore, NLP that had been formed in relatively high amounts of serum (5&#x02013;10&#x00025;) displayed a finer and more granular structure when compared with NLP formed in the complete absence or low amounts of serum (less than 1&#x00025;), which appeared as coarse aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Chemical composition of NLP and NB and acquisition of phosphate and HAP by amorphous calcium complexes</title><p>Irrespective of their initial composition, all calcium-based NLP samples (102 tested to date) could be shown by EDX to acquire phosphorus following incubation in DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02013;H</xref>). The rates of P acquisition were both time and temperature dependent, and at 37&#x000b0;C, acquisition reached stable calcium:phosphorus ratios (or Ca&#x02236;P ratios) between 1 and 2 Ca to 1 P, after a 1&#x02013;3 day incubation, with the final Ca&#x02236;P ratio eventually becoming independent of the initial Ca&#x02236;P ratios used to form NLP. That is, even amorphous calcium carbonate particles that had been formed in the absence of phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) could be shown to avidly bind P and to gradually convert to calcium phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g002">Fig. 2B and C</xref>).

This variability seen with the Ca&#x02236;P ratios, which differs significantly from the stoichiometric Ca&#x02236;P ratio of 1.67 associated with pure HAP, appears to be a common finding linked to the structure of bone and have been attributed to amorphous calcium carbonate and amorphous phosphate intermediates as well as small and incompletely crystallized carbonate-HAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Boskey1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Posner1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

P absorption was detected immediately after the 30 minutes of incubation used to form NLP and appeared to increase steadily with time, followed generally by sharp increases within short spans of time that typically occurred between 1 hour and several days depending on the incubation temperature.

Like their NLP counterpart, NB that had been subcultured in 10&#x00025; FBS also showed finer and more granular precipitates as compared with those cultured without serum or with low amounts of this supplement.</p><p>Conversion to HAP could be ascertained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), which also revealed a time and temperature dependent process. Immediately after formation, some of the NLP complexes revealed either amorphous patterns with no discernible crystalline peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) or mono-calcium phosphate peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Following incubation at room temperature or 37&#x000b0;C, peaks eventually shifted to correspond to larger crystalline forms, reaching eventually Ca<sub>9</sub> calcium phosphate compounds or Ca<sub>10</sub> compounds corresponding to HAP within 1&#x02013;2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3C and D</xref>; compare signals with the CaCO<sub>3</sub>, calcium phosphate, HAP controls shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3G&#x02013;I</xref>). Accumulation of HAP showed marked variability as a function of time, with some samples displaying HAP peaks after only 30 minutes of incubation, but typically more extensive incubations varying between several hours to 2 days were needed for this conversion. Even at room temperature or at 4&#x000b0;C, conversion to HAP could still be seen, albeit with much slower kinetics (not shown). In fact, samples that had initially shown only amorphous patterns and that had been washed and suspended in water alone at 4&#x000b0;C also showed conversion to HAP when examined two weeks later (not shown). Based on serial observations made during regular intervals, there appeared again to be a rapid conversion to HAP within a short span of time; however, the onset of this sharp HAP conversion could not be defined accurately given the wide margin of error seen with each experiment.</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of NLP and NB.</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) Various amorphous and crystalline patterns are associated with NLP.

By visual inspection, the NLP pellets formed in the presence of high amounts of carbonate or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> were not only smaller in volume, decreasing in inverse proportion to an increase in the concentration of either carbonate or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but in the case of excess carbonate, they also looked white-chalky and were easier to disperse. In contrast, NLP formed with low amounts of either carbonate or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> were not only more voluminous but also more gelatinous, sticky, and grayish in appearance, and were much harder to disperse. The effects of carbonate and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> were clearly additive. The same morphological and visual impressions seen with high levels of input carbonate also correlated with higher Ca&#x02236;P ratios, as revealed by EDX analysis, with Ca&#x02236;P ratio reaching 2&#x02236;1 or higher ratios when NLP were formed with carbonate:phosphate ratios of 8&#x02236;1 (data not shown). In the case of both excess carbonate and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies also revealed higher carbonate peaks with a much slower rise for the phosphate peak. XRD analysis demonstrated a slower accumulation of HAP under these same conditions, with the initial predominance of amorphous patterns and mono-calcium phosphate peaks that converted much more slowly to HAP crystals (not shown). The influence of carbonate and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on NLP formation may be physiologically relevant given the high concentrations of these ions in the culture medium. For example, as noted earlier for DMEM, carbonate at 44 mM exceeds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (1.8 mM) by 24 times and phosphate (0.9 mM) by 49 times. At such high carbonate:phosphate ratios, it would appear that carbonate should inhibit HAP accumulation and biofilm formation while favoring the formation of small, coccoid-like amorphous calcium particles which nonetheless should still be expected to slowly accumulate HAP and gradually convert into biofilms. That is, while HAP inhibitors like carbonate or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are seen to delay the accumulation of HAP by NLP in culture medium, the much higher binding affinity known to exist between calcium and phosphate, as compared with calcium and carbonate, should still favor nevertheless the irreversible formation of HAP over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Inhibitory effect of serum on NLP formation</title><p>Having established that NLP and NB are morphologically and chemically equivalent, the earlier unexpected, serum-mediated inhibition on NB formation prompted us to revisit with this phenomenon by studying the role of serum in NLP formation, since the latter is more amenable to biochemical characterization than the elusive NB phenomenology. The effects of serum on NLP formation could be analyzed in a similar manner, as done initially with NB, using different amounts as well as sources of serum. Thus, under the conditions studied, FBS and HS were shown to support NLP formation in low amounts (up to 1&#x00025; vol.&#x02236;vol.). However, as seen earlier for NB, serum was found to inhibit NLP formation at higher amounts, and this inhibitory effect was much more pronounced with FBS than with HS, as demonstrated by the dose-dependence experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g009">Figure 9A and B</xref>. At 1&#x00025; or more FBS, inhibition of NLP formation could be seen with 1 mM each of calcium, carbonate and phosphate levels added, while HS inhibited NLP formation at 5&#x00025; or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g009">Fig. 9B</xref> shows inhibitory effect only up to 10&#x00025; serum but similar inhibition was seen with higher serum concentrations). The amount of inhibition depended on the exogenous amounts of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate added, with higher amounts of these reagents clearly overriding the inhibitory effects of serum. Thus, when 10 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate was present, 3&#x00025; or more FBS and 10&#x00025; HS were needed to exert similar inhibitory effects (not shown). Conversely, as shown earlier, when 1&#x00025; of FBS was maintained constant throughout the precipitation experiment, this same inhibition could be overridden with 3 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g001">Fig. 1B, 2<sup>nd</sup> row, labeled &#x0201c;1&#x00025; FBS&#x0201d;</xref>).

Note that FBS had a stronger, dose-dependent inhibitory effect on NLP formation in all 3 situations when compared with HS. Inhibition could be seen for 2 weeks at 4&#x000b0;C, but at 37&#x000b0;C, it was overcome after 1 week, and this release of inhibition was more evident with HS.

At higher temperatures like room temperature or 37&#x000b0;C, however, this inhibition turned out to be transient, and after 1 week of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, precipitation of NLP became noticeable even in the wells containing as high as 30&#x00025; FBS or HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g009">Fig. 9E and F</xref>). The initial inhibition period varied also as a function of the input levels of calcium, carbonate and phosphate, and inhibition was prolonged for a longer period of time with lower levels of calcium, carbonate and phosphate inoculated. At 3 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate, the initial inhibition seen with various doses of FBS could be sustained for at least 3 days, whereas the inhibition seen with its HS counterpart was completely overcome after this incubation. Likewise, at 10 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate, the initial inhibition seen with both FBS and HS was seen to be overridden after 2 days, even with the higher doses of FBS and HS used (not shown). Longer periods of inhibition were also observed with incubation done at room temperature. In general, by two weeks of incubation at room temperature, the inhibitory effect produced by serum was completely overcome irrespective of the amount of FBS or HS used (up to 30&#x00025;; data not shown). However, the NLP precipitates formed at widely different doses of serum appeared different to visual inspection. Thus, NLP formed in the presence of 5&#x00025; or more of FBS appeared finer and more granular in texture, while NLP formed in the absence of serum or at 1&#x00025; or lower amounts of FBS appeared coarse and clumpy. On the other hand, these same differences were not as obvious with different amounts of HS.</p><p>NLP formation seen both in the presence and absence of serum was dependent on calcium, as shown by the inhibition produced with either EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g009">Fig. 9G</xref>) or EGTA (not shown), or by using DMEM containing no calcium (also not shown). On the other hand, DMEM without phosphate still produced NLP precipitates but these were significantly smaller in volume as compared to those seen with control medium (not shown).</p><p>The inhibitory effects of serum on NLP formation could be overcome in the presence of trypsin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g010">Figure 10A and C</xref> show the serum-dependent inhibition on NLP precipitation produced by 1 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate inoculated into DMEM, followed by overnight incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. As expected from earlier experiments, increasing amounts of FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>) or HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g010">Fig. 10C</xref>) were seen to inhibit NLP formation. Treatment with 0.5&#x00025; trypsin under these conditions not only removed the serum-mediated inhibition but appeared to facilitate NLP formation as a function of the amount of serum added, with more serum inducing more precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g010">Fig. 10B and D</xref>). That is, rather than being inhibitory, both FBS and HS added in the presence of trypsin now induced a dose-dependent accumulation of NLP.

All three protein bands associated with FBS NLP (a prominent 72 kDa band, and two fainter bands of 54 kDa and 30 kDa) disappeared under our trypsin treatment conditions. The proteins associated with both NB and NLP will be discussed in greater detail later in this study. As a further control, trypsin alone was shown as a 25 kDa protein, unrelated to any of the three bands shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g010">Fig. 10I, lane 3</xref>). These results clearly indicate that factors which inhibit calcium or apatite crystallization are present in both sera, but that higher amounts are present in FBS compared to HS. These factors initially inhibit the formation of NLP, but this inhibition can be overcome slowly by means of a spontaneous and temperature-dependent process or much more rapidly by trypsin treatment. These observations suggest that the same trypsin-sensitive inhibitory factors may be proteinaceous in nature. Once released of this trypsin-sensitive inhibition, both FBS and HS are now seen to enhance the formation of NLP in a serum dose-dependent manner, implying that non-proteinaceous factors may be present in both FBS and HS that support the formation of NLP, but these become effective only when the initial trypsin-sensitive inhibitory step has been overcome.</p><p>Once formed, these same NLP could be transferred to new culture medium by serial passage, similar to what had been reported earlier for NB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. NLP formed in the presence or absence of serum could be transferred to either serum-free or serum-containing medium, or alternately. However, in our hands, the serial passage of NLP through serum-free DMEM resulted in the progressive decrease of precipitates in contrast to that seen with serum-containing DMEM. Likewise, the inoculation of NLP to DMEM with high amounts of serum (10&#x00025; or more) also produced stagnation of NLP growth, which reverted only after several weeks of incubation. This slow growth of NLP could be accelerated by inoculating NLP into DMEM containing lower amounts of FBS. As detailed later, by subjecting NLP to passage through various kinds of culture conditions, we found that the chemical composition of NLP could also be modulated.</p><p>This inhibitory effect of serum, being more pronounced with FBS, stands in contrast against the bulk of NB literature that had previously used both FBS and HS not only as sources of NB but also as sources of nutrients to support NB proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

The protein profiles obtained for the NLP prepared in FBS and HS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Figure 11C and D</xref>. Both profiles essentially consisted of three major bands of molecular weight of about 70 kDa (ranging from 66 to 75 kDa), 60 kDa (range of 52&#x02013;65 kDa), and 30 kDa (range of 27&#x02013;33 kDa). We noticed that the position of the middle band varied significantly with the lot of serum used, sometimes associating with sub-bands, and it was generally lower in the case of human material when compared with its bovine counterpart.</p><p>We reasoned that the discrepancies seen between the various preparations of NLP or NB could be due to the differences in the serum input and incubation conditions associated with the various methodologies used to generate NLP/NB. In the case of Raoult et al.'s study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the three prominent bands were only obtained after diluting &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; in serum-free medium and using silver nitrate for staining, compared to the less sensitive Coomassie blue stain used here. To address this issue, we incubated NB obtained from HS in serum-free DMEM at 37&#x000b0;C. The precipitate collected after 3 days in serum-free conditions was then washed in DMEM and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as before. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Figure 11E</xref>, only the three main bands of 66&#x02013;75 kDa, 52&#x02013;65 kDa, and 27&#x02013;33 kDa were again prominently seen (contrast this profile with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Fig. 11A</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that these three bands, obtained for both bovine and human NLP, are virtually indistinguishable from the gel profile published by Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> for &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; grown initially in FBS and maintained in serum-free conditions. In our hands, the so-called &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; maintained in serum free conditions for 5 days gave only a weak band at 70 kDa and two faint bands at 60 kDa and 30 kDa when stained by Coomassie blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Fig. 11F, lane 1</xref>). However, when the same samples were passaged twice through DMEM containing 10&#x00025; FBS, the two bands of 70 kDa and 30 kDa gained prominence while the 60 kDa band remained barely visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Fig. 11F, lane 2</xref>). When next passaged through serum-free conditions, the same bands again became progressively fainter with time until they disappeared (not shown). It appears that the passage of &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; through serum-free conditions done earlier by Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and repeated here exerted not only a selection for more strongly-binding proteins but also a diluting effect on serum proteins that adhere to NB.</p><p>To confirm this notion, we analyzed next the protein profiles of whole sera that were used for the preparation of NLP and NB.

It is clear however that with continued passage in serum-free conditions, even the three predominant protein bands will eventually disappear or remain barely visible by Coomassie blue staining, which may explain why Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> had to use a much more sensitive dye (silver nitrate) to visualize these same protein bands in serum-free conditions. Furthermore, the protein smear found associated with NB, accompanied by the fading of the three prominent bands for example, could represent the result of proteolytic breakdown of serum proteins following prolonged incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Together, these data clarify an important aspect of the NB phenomenology, namely the possibility that the NB protein coating may be derived from direct calcium or apatite binding to common serum proteins that seemingly are also among the more abundant proteins in the serum.</p><p>Since serum has been routinely used both as a source progenitor as well as a nutrient basis for NB, we next sought to study further the influence of the serum milieu on the protein profiles of both NLP and NB. We reasoned that the protein coating of NLP/NB should mirror their passage history with regards to the presence or absence of serum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Figure 13A</xref> shows the protein gel profile of human NB maintained in 5&#x00025; HS (lane 1) that had been inoculated into serum-free DMEM (lanes 2&#x02013;4). The gradual disappearance of protein bands was obvious over a course of several days, with the three more predominant bands remaining by the end of day 6 (lane 4). The same phenomenon could be seen with the DSM 5821 strain, cultured in 2&#x00025; FBS, that was subsequently inoculated into serum-free FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13B</xref>). Again, over a period of several days, only a few major bands remained (contrast lane 4 obtained on day 6 of incubation with lane 1, obtained for DSM 5821 particles maintained in 2&#x00025; FBS). Conversely, similar passage histories could be established with human NLP obtained with exogenous calcium-carbonate-phosphate ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13C</xref>). Here, human NLP showing only three major bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13C, lane 2</xref>) were first contrasted with the smear of bands seen with NB obtained by inoculation of 10&#x00025; HS into DMEM using published protocols as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13C, lane 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Figure 13C</xref> shows that these same NLP could be made to acquire many other protein bands when inoculated into DMEM containing 10&#x00025; HS (lanes 3&#x02013;7). By day 10, there was a large increase of lower molecular weight bands accompanied by a decrease of the 70 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13C, lane 6</xref>). After 14 days of incubation in the presence of serum, the protein profile seen associated with the precipitating particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13C, lane 7</xref>) closely resembled the protein profile of NB (lane 1). Similar results were obtained with NLP formed in the absence of serum and that had been inoculated subsequently into DMEM containing 5&#x00025; FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13D, lanes 2&#x02013;7</xref>). There was a gradual smearing of the protein bands, with a loss of the 70 kDa band and an increase of low molecular weight bands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13D, lanes 6 and 7</xref>, corresponding respectively to days 10 and 14 of incubation in the presence of 5&#x00025; FBS). Again, this profile was virtually indistinguishable from that obtained for DSM 5820 maintained in 10&#x00025; FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g013">Fig. 13D, lane 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g013" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g013</object-id><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>Protein profiles of NLP and NB as determined by their passage through serum-free or serum-containing medium.</title><p>(A) Protein profile of HS NB maintained in DMEM containing 5&#x00025; HS (lane 1) followed by transfer to serum-free DMEM and incubation for 1 day (lane 2), 4 days (lane 3), and 6 days (lane 4), after which proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

A gradual increase of bands of low molecular weight could be seen along with a fading of the high molecular weight bands, especially the 70&#x02013;72 kDa band. (D) Protein profiles of NB strain DSM 5820 maintained in 10&#x00025; &#x003b3;-irradiated FBS (lane 1) and FBS NLP obtained as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, except that 5&#x00025; FBS was added to the precipitating mixture (lane 2).

By day 14, the protein profile of these FBS NLP, with an increase in the number of bands and a loss of the 70&#x02013;72 kDa band, closely resembled that of DSM 5820 (lane 1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004417.g013"/></fig><p>Using this approach, that is, by simply interchanging culture serum conditions, we were able to obtain protein profiles for NB and NLP that were virtually identical to each other. Even the serum species (bovine versus human) could be interchanged resulting in final profiles that were virtually indistinguishable from native configurations (not shown). Since the numerous previous NB studies relied largely on inoculating human tissue homogenates or body fluids into FBS-containing medium, this same interchange of species may very well have happened at the level of NB protein coating. Since all protein gel profiles here were obtained after repeated washes in high ionic strength buffers, we conclude that these complex protein profiles may represent the true NB composition. On the other hand, the marked reduction of the number of bands associated with NB seen under serum-free conditions, observed here as well as in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Cisar1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, can be explained by a dilution effect, with the initial serum proteins bound to NB becoming diluted by new mineral complexes being formed, eventually ending with just the more abundant proteins remaining visible. Upon being reinoculated back into serum-containing medium, new serum proteins adhere to the NB complexes, thereby starting a new cycle with respect to protein composition. This alternative view further implies that NB are not only lifeless entities but their protein coating is a direct result of binding to proteins found in the surrounding milieu.</p><p>It is not clear why the various NB specimens or strains studied show variability in their protein profile when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We have noticed that in the case of &#x0201c;nanons,&#x0201d; the number of protein bands is significantly fewer than that seen with NB or with the DSM 5819&#x02013;5821 strains. That is, while NB and the DSM strains tend to show protein smears on SDS-gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Fig. 11A and B</xref>, respectively), &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; that have been maintained in DMEM in the presence of FBS show a simple profile consisting of a few major bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g011">Fig. 11F, lane 2</xref>). However, based on chemical and morphological analyses, &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; and the other NB specimens and strains do not display any noticeable differences.

However, to our initial surprise, and in contrast to the earlier findings of Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> implying fetuin-A as the major constituent of NB, fetuin-A was not found consistently in the various samples analyzed. In fact, we obtained fetuin-A in less than half of the trials (14/35) for FBS NLP, and in one fourth of the trials (4/15) for HS NLP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t001">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, in our hands, we were not able to detect fetuin-A in human NB obtained from human serum according to published protocols as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> (data not shown). Other proteins such as albumin (16 out 50 combined trials for both bovine and human material), vitamin D-binding protein (4/50), anti-thrombin-III precursor (4/50), &#x003b1;1-anti-trypsin precursor (2/50), immunoglobulin-G chain C region (1/50), and immunoglobulin-M chain C region (1/50) were also obtained at this position. These observations suggest that the amount of HSF in this 52&#x02013;65 kDa band is probably much lower than its bovine counterpart, and that other proteins may contribute to the intensity of the band seen in this position.</p><p>The third lower major bands of 27&#x02013;33 kDa seen on the protein profiles of FBS and HS NLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g014">Fig. 14A and B</xref>) were identified as bovine apolipoprotein A1 (8/9) and human apolipoprotein A1 (2/3), respectively (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t001">Table 1</xref>). This result is consistent with Raoult et al.'s determination made on &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; grown in FBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the minor band of 95 kDa seen on the FBS NLP protein profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g014">Fig. 14A</xref>; position marked by the full square symbol) was identified as serotransferrin precursor (2/2). On the other hand, the high molecular weight bands seen in HS NLP at the 95 kDa, 130 kDa, and 170 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g014">Fig. 14B</xref>, marked by the three other symbols), were identified respectively as human complement C3 (2/2), human antithrombin (2/2), and, again, as human complement C3 (2/2).</p><p>To verify whether these same proteins corresponded to the major bands seen with whole serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g012">Fig. 12</xref>), the three main bands from the serum protein gels were also excised and submitted to identification by MALDI-TOF mass fingerprint analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g012">Fig. 12, lanes 5 and 10, marked by white dots</xref>). Albumin and apolipoprotein A1 were readily identified from both human and fetal bovine serum materials (1/1 each), but fetuin-A was not found in the 52&#x02013;65 kDa band for either human or fetal bovine serum (2/2 each). Instead, interleukin-8 precursor (1/2) and BSA (1/2) were obtained at the 52&#x02013;65 kDa position in whole FBS. For HS, we obtained &#x003b1;-1-syntrophin (1/2) and an uncharacterized protein KIAA0774 (1/2) at this position. Although it is likely that more sample trials would have identified fetuin-A, it is clear from these results that other proteins appear to contribute equally, if not more predominantly, to the intensity of this 52&#x02013;65 kDa band. These results confirm the notion that the proteins found associated with NB largely reflect their predominance in the serum.</p><p>Several precautions were taken to ensure that the proteins associated with NLP were separated from the mineral phase prior to gel electrophoresis. Such precautions included treatment of NLP samples with 50 mM EDTA, 2.5&#x00025; &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol or 0.1 M DTT, and 2&#x00025; SDS, followed by heating at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes prior to electrophoresis. However, even under these conditions, the protein-mineral complexes were not completely dissolved as judged by the presence of small precipitates seen with subsequent centrifugation and by the retention of high molecular weight complexes visible in the space between the spacer and separating gels when the treated NLP samples subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. In order to both circumvent this problem and have a more thorough determination of the entire protein repertoire associated with NLP, we also used in-solution trypsin digestion of untreated NLP samples followed by separation of the resulting peptides by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and their identification by tandem MS/MS analysis. Using this technique, several other high molecular weight proteins were found in addition to the three proteins mentioned earlier and displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t001">Table 1</xref> that were not readily visible by SDS-PAGE. These proteins included, in descending molecular weight, apolipoprotein B100 (516 kDa; 5/5 in HS NLP), apolipoprotein(a) (501 kDa; 1/5 in HS NLP), coagulation factor V (249 kDa; 4/13 in FBS NLP), complement component 4A (193 kDa; 5/5 in HS NLP), and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (163 kDa; 2/13 in FBS NLP; 5/5 in HS NLP). We noted the presence of other calcium-binding proteins like vitamin-D-binding protein (53 kDa; 12/13 in FBS NLP; 4/5 in HS NLP) and kininogen-1 (48 kDa; 5/5 in HS NLP). Fibronectin (257 kDa; 1/13 in FBS NLP; 5/5 in HS NLP) and vitronectin (54 kDa; 5/5 in HS NLP), two human serum proteins deemed to be potent nucleators of HAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Rohanizadeh1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, which were also found associated with the mineral phase of NLP.</p><p>That multiple proteins should bind to carbonate HAP used in these experiments is consistent with the well-known protein-binding affinity displayed by both this mineral and calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Hjertens1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of phosphate groups on HAP crystals allows for their binding to basic amino acids from various proteins. In fact, it is this broad affinity for proteins that has made HAP useful for protein purification in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Hjertens1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Earlier, Raoult categorized NB as &#x0201c;fetuin-mineralo complexes&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In their study, fetuin-A was shown to be present in NB cultured from both FBS and renal stones. Based on our own results, albumin must also be considered a major component of NB/NLP. In fact, in our hands, of the proteins discernible by SDS-PAGE, albumin has turned out to be the most abundant protein species associated with NB/NLP, be them of human or fetal bovine origin. Not surprisingly, albumin is one of the major proteins found in both human and bovine serum, where it is known to be present at concentrations as high as 35&#x02013;45 mg/ml in human serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Wong1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and 23 mg/ml in FBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Johansson1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, fetuin-A, while abundant in FBS at 10&#x02013;21 mg/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Brown1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, is found at levels of 0.7&#x02013;0.8 mg/ml in the adult human serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Hendig1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, or at levels that are 14&#x02013;26&#x000d7; lower than those found in FBS.</p><p>As noted earlier, we failed to find fetuin-A in human NB cultured directly from HS, in spite of repeated attempts to sequence the 52&#x02013;65 kDa protein band from gels. Fetuin-A was however found in both human NLP freshly prepared using calcium-carbonate-phosphate precipitation in the presence of HS, as well as in FBS-derived NB and NLP. These discrepancies may simply be due to the differences in concentrations of fetuin-A and albumin found in FBS versus HS. Compared to albumin, fetuin-A may be more selectively enriched and concentrated by both NLP and NB. For one, fetuin-A is known to display much stronger binding affinity for calcium (calcium-binding constants of 0.95&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M for BSF and 1.24&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M for HSF) than albumin (7&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M for BSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, fetuin-A displays unique apatite-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss1">&#x0005b;ref. 25&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-JahnenDechent1">&#x0005b;reviewed in ref. 27&#x0005d;</xref>. Given these unique binding properties and the high concentration of fetuin-A in FBS, it would make sense for fetuin-A to be enriched in FBS-derived NB over other proteins. In the case of human fetuin-A, however, since it is found in much lower levels in HS compared to FBS, it does not seem to correspond to a major protein species of human NB in spite of its known high affinity for calcium and apatite.</p><p>These findings support the notion that the presence of the three predominant serum proteins as well as other proteins in NB may be largely circumstantial in the sense that it mirrors their availability in the milieu in which NB are being formed. In support of this view, even though albumin binds more weakly to calcium than fetuin-A, it had previously been shown to account for at least half of the calcium binding capacity quantified for HS, mainly due to its high serum concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Garnett1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, Heiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss3">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> observed a similar prominence of albumin over fetuin-A in the constitution of the so-called &#x0201c;secondary calciprotein particles&#x0201d; obtained from human ascites, in spite of the stronger calcium-binding affinity of fetuin-A.</p><p>It should be noted that there are many other proteins that have been previously shown to bind to calcium and apatite and that may interact with NB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Boskey1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ketteler1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, our own findings here point to the presence of multiple calcium-binding proteins present in the NB and NLP scaffold. For the first time, however, our ability to dissect NB through the reconstitution experiments described here provides a conceptual framework that explains the origin and nature of the protein repertoire found associated with NB.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>NB and NLP associated with other body fluids and their protein identification</title><p>To assess whether the NB/NLP phenomenon dissected here is unique to serum-derived materials, we inoculated several other body fluids into DMEM in order to form NB. Samples of saliva, urine, ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusion, and synovial fluid were centrifuged, membrane-filtered, and directly inoculated into serum-free DMEM at dilutions between 1&#x02236;10 and 1&#x02236;100. Saliva was obtained from normal volunteers whereas the other fluids were obtained from pathological specimens. All samples resulted in slow, dose-dependent precipitation of particles after an initial incubation of 3&#x02013;8 days. NB formed in this way could be passaged serially through DMEM without serum for at least three cycles (not shown). The only fluid that gave negative or marginal NB formation was urine. To enhance NB formation with urine, samples were obtained from pathological specimens collected from patients showing various degrees of kidney damage and proteinuria. We noticed that a higher level of proteinuria corresponded in general with a higher propensity of the same urine samples to form NB precipitates when inoculated into DMEM.</p><p>When examined by SEM and TEM, the NB formed from these fluids showed marked morphological similarity to the NB formed from serum (not shown). These same fluids also yielded large amounts of NLP when precipitated with a combination of calcium-carbonate-phosphate (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) that were virtually identical to the NB formed by their inoculation and slow incubation in DMEM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g015">Figure 15</xref> shows representative SDS-PAGE profiles for NLP obtained from the various body fluids mentioned earlier.

As seen for NLP derived from each fluid sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g015">Fig. 15A&#x02013;F</xref>), relatively simple protein profiles were obtained, consisting of a few major bands, with the most prominent band being around 66&#x02013;75 kDa. With the exception of the saliva sample, albumin was the predominant protein species found in this band for all the NLP studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g015">Fig. 15B&#x02013;F</xref>).

That fetuin-A could not be found in any one of the fluid samples studied here reinforces our contention that the protein make-up of NB may be circumstantial at best, and it may depend entirely on the availability of specific calcium-binding proteins in the surrounding milieu. In this sense, none of the calcium or apatite-binding proteins shown here or elsewhere can be deemed to be absolutely necessary for generating NB.</p><p>To further verify this point, namely that the protein profile of NB from any one of these fluids, not just serum, can be morphed according to the protein constituents in the surrounding milieu, the following serial passage experiments were done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g016">Fig. 16</xref>).

The same saliva NLP maintained in serum-free medium were then washed and introduced into DMEM containing 5&#x00025; HS, and gel profiles were again obtained after incubation for 1 day (lane 4) and 12 days (lane 5). Note that upon inoculation into serum, the protein-free complexes immediately acquired the same three major bands described before, along with some other minor bands, making these saliva NLP virtually indistinguishable from the serum-derived NLP or NB studied earlier.

Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that irrespective of the origin of any NB, be them from serum or from any other body fluid, their protein composition will largely mirror the protein constitution of the culture medium used for their maintenance and growth.</p><p>The exhaustive protein identification done here with NLP and NB derived from serum (a total of 142 trials) as well as other body fluids (a total of 57 trials) can be used to assert the conclusion that, in our hands, every single NB-associated protein found to date corresponds to eukaryotic proteins that have previously been characterized and identified in the respective compartmental fluids from which they were derived. This finding makes unlikely the possibility that any foreign proteins, including non-eukaryotic proteins, may be present in NB that cannot be explained by simple, physical binding by known proteins to calcium or apatite. This conclusion stands in marked contrast with the earlier inferences of novel prokaryotic proteins including porins and complex peptidoglycans being associated with NB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Hjelle1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> and with later reports that have claimed to have identified specific NB-associated bacterial sequences like elongation factor Tu and GroEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kumar1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Immunological specificity of NB antibodies and cross-reactivity with albumin and fetuin-A</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies deemed specific for human NB, available through Nanobac Oy, are now routinely used in immunoblotting and tissue staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Miller1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kumar1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu4">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. These same reagents have been used in numerous studies as confirmatory tools to establish the presence of NB in human diseased tissues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref> provides a listing of some of these studies along with a description of the source of material used to generate NB such as the presence or absence of serum used for their culture, and the type of antibody as well as the immunological method employed to detect them. Given the critical importance of these reagents in the context of demonstrating the presence of NB in various human pathologies, it is surprising how little, if any, information is known about these monoclonal antibodies with regards to their immunological specificity. Most of these studies relied on techniques such as tissue immunostaining, ELISA, and dot blotting, which do not give information on the molecular weight or the specificity of the target antigen. Only a few studies have tried to address the specificity issue of the NB antibodies. For instance, Vali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Vali1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> had shown that NB monoclonal antibodies 8/0 and 5/2 bind to two protein bands of 35 kDa and 66 kDa, with the latter attributed to albumin, which the authors discarded as non-specific binding. Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Miller1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> showed reactivity of antibody 8D10 against one single band of 50 kDa from cultures of human calcified arteries deemed to contain NB. We, on the other hand, demonstrated that this antibody 8D10 as well as the other commonly used NB-specific monoclonal antibody 5/3 strongly react, in fact, with both human and bovine albumin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Martel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that this same monoclonal antibody 8D10 reacted against fetuin-A present in &#x0201c;nanons.&#x0201d; Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies raised against fetuin-A also reacted against &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; maintained in the presence of 10&#x00025; FBS as well as against human kidney stones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These last two studies call in question the specificity of NB antibodies as well as the relevance and significance of previous immunostaining studies done with these same reagents. That monoclonal antibodies marketed as being specific for NB should react against common serum proteins like albumin and fetuin-A is disconcerting since one would have expected to find either bacterial or novel proteins identified with such &#x0201c;specific&#x0201d; reagents should the protein coating of NB be derived in fact from active bacterial protein synthesis, as initially inferred from the NB literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Hjelle1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, these results lend support to the notion extended here that the protein coating of NB is derived from the simple absorption of serum or other compartmentalized fluid proteins to nucleating mineral complexes.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004417-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>NB literature

As albumin and fetuin-A are among the two main species that we have found associated with NLP/NB, we next sought to determine the immunological cross-reactivity between these two proteins in an attempt to explain why antibodies raised against NB cultured in FBS should be able to detect epitopes in human tissue antigens. Moreover, this analysis was further justified by the many studies published to date relying on these same antibody reagents to produce identification of NB in human diseased tissues. The rampant use of these reagents for such determination is problematic, to say the least, since it is clear that precipitating minerals bind to serum proteins present in the culture medium, casting doubt as what epitopes exactly, not to mention their species origin, the antibodies are really binding to.</p><p>In line with this reasoning, it should be noted that fetuin-A (349 amino acids in the human form; 341 a.a., bovine) and albumin (585 a.a., human; 583 a.a., bovine) are known to share limited homology ranging from 11 to 13&#x00025; identity and 17&#x02013;19&#x00025; similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g017">Fig. 17A</xref>). The identity regions, while scattered throughout the length of the two sequences, appear to be a bit more clustered toward the N-terminus of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g017">Fig. 17B</xref>). Accordingly, only fetuin-A is known to harbor a unique N-terminal cystatin-like domain which has been shown to be required for its high calcification inhibitory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutational analysis and computer modeling of domain structures have suggested that a dense array of acidic residues on an extended &#x003b2;-sheet of the cystatin-like domain of fetuin-A mediates efficient inhibition of this type of mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The low homology between the two proteins may also explain earlier immunoblotting experiments that demonstrated weak immunological cross-reactivity between the two species that became apparent only following protein reduction and alkylation, which may have unfolded hidden homologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ruoslahti1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g017" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g017</object-id><label>Figure 17</label><caption><title>Sequence homology between fetuin-A and albumin.</title><p>(A) Sequences were compared with the ClustalW program.

As antigens, we used NLP obtained from both FBS and HS as well as commercially available purified albumin and fetuin-A (both human and bovine forms; in the case of fetuin-A, both purified protein and a human recombinant form were used). As positive controls, whole sera (HS and FBS) were also used. Given the limited immunological cross-reactivity known to exist between these two proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ruoslahti1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, all the antigens tested were electrophoresed under reducing conditions using excess dithiothreitol (DTT) at 100 mM or 2.5&#x00025; &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18A</xref>, a polyclonal antibody raised against BSF, referred in the Figure as p-&#x003b1;-BSF, was shown to react with both FBS and FBS-derived NLP giving two prominent bands of 66&#x02013;75 kDa and 52&#x02013;65 kDa, when compared against the molecular weight standards used. This same antibody also reacted with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a strong 66&#x02013;75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18A, lane 3</xref>). Against purified BSF used as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18A, lane 4</xref>), this polyclonal antibody reacted with at least two bands of 66&#x02013;75 kDa and 52&#x02013;65 kDa, similar to what was seen earlier with both FBS and FBS NLP (compare with lanes 1 and 2). In this respect, fetuin-A had earlier been shown to be heavily glycosylated, and this protein is known to assume multiple sizes when studied by SDS-PAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Cartellieri1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. The strong reactivity of this anti-BSF antibody against purified BSA (lane 3) suggests that bovine albumin and fetuin-A are antigenically cross-reactive under reducing conditions. However, the multiplicity of forms assumed by fetuin-A precludes us from drawing a firm conclusion as to whether the upper band seen with FBS and FBS NLP (lanes 1 and 2) represents cross-reactive albumin or a larger form of fetuin-A.</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g018" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g018</object-id><label>Figure 18</label><caption><title>NB-specific antibodies cross-react with albumin and fetuin-A.</title><p>Western blots on various bovine and human protein samples (bottom of each blot) were done using the indicated antibodies (to the right of each blot). Antigens used include FBS NLP and HS NLP obtained as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g014">Fig. 14</xref>; purified BSA, BSF, HSF, and human recombinant fetuin-A (HRF); and whole FBS and HS. Antibodies used include a polyclonal antibody directed against BSF (p-&#x003b1;-BSF); a monoclonal antibody directed against BSA (m-&#x003b1;-BSA); a polyclonal antibody directed against HSF (p-&#x003b1;-HSF); and the monoclonal antibodies 8D10, NB 5/3, and NB G1B8 directed against bovine NB antigens (m-&#x003b1;-NB 8D10, m-&#x003b1;-NB 5/3, and m-&#x003b1;-NB G1B8, respectively). All gels were run under denaturing and reducing conditions except for (L and M), which were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004417.g018"/></fig><p>That such polyclonal antibodies prepared against BSF could cross species (bovine vs. human) was confirmed by using HS and HS-derived NLP as antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18B, lanes 1 and 2</xref>). This time, weakly reactive bands were seen at the 66&#x02013;75 kDa position, while a 52&#x02013;65 kDa band reacted much more strongly. Controls using HSA as antigen again showed strong reactivity by a single band of 66&#x02013;75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18B, lane 3</xref>). It is clear from these immunoblots that the lower 52&#x02013;65 kDa band can be assigned to fetuin-A (compare also with lane 4 containing BSF), whereas the upper 66&#x02013;75 kDa band represents either albumin or fetuin-A in both the bovine and human species. However, it appears safe to conclude that the polyclonal antiserum prepared against bovine fetuin-A reacts with purified BSA, HSA and BSF, as well as with HSF found in both HS and NLP derived from HS. Together, these experiments reveal at least four levels of reactivity by a single antiserum, not only seen between different proteins of the same species but also with different proteins across species, illustrating the complexity of the NB phenomenology observed here as well as providing a basis for the ambiguous and problematic nature of the entire body of immunostaining data published to date on NB.</p><p>The type of cross-reactivity seen here could be extended to other antibodies, including monoclonals. Using a monoclonal antibody derived against BSA, referred as m-&#x003b1;-BSA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18C</xref>, we were able to react with the same bovine antigens used before in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18A</xref>. Thus, FBS, FBS NLP, and BSA, used as antigens, all gave a single broad band migrating as 66&#x02013;75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18C, lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Against BSF, however, this monoclonal antibody reacted with a lower band of 52&#x02013;65 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18C, lane 4</xref>). The same larger form of BSF seen earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18A</xref> was not found to react with this antibody, perhaps pointing to differences in immunological reactivity between the two antibodies. It is not clear also why this same antibody did not react with the 52&#x02013;65 kDa form of BSF presumably present in FBS NLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18C, lane 2</xref>), as would have been expected from the reactivity seen with purified BSF (lane 4). When this same monoclonal m-&#x003b1;-BSA was used against human antigens similar to those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18B</xref>, again single bands were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18D, lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>) that were virtually identical to those seen with bovine antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">compare lanes 1&#x02013;3, Fig. 18D with Fig. 18C</xref>). However this antibody did not react against a human recombinant form of fetuin-A (HRF; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18D, lane 4</xref>), suggesting that the protein species reactive in lanes 1&#x02013;3 corresponds indeed to human albumin. Thus, using this monoclonal antibody specific for BSA, one can conclude that albumin is present in both bovine and human NLP. These results further illustrate the individual differences seen with each antibody used, substantiating our concern for unwarranted conclusions that may be drawn with any one of them in the absence of proper controls.</p><p>A third polyclonal anti-human fetuin-A, labeled as p-&#x003b1;-HSF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18E and F</xref>, produced yet another level of immunological cross-reactivity by binding to a single band of HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18E, lane 1</xref>), HS NLP (lane 2), and purified HSA (lane 3) as well as HRF which produced a much broader band, perhaps with multiple sub-bands (lanes 4). The same antiserum was also used against bovine antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18F</xref>). It did not react with either FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18F, lane 1), FBS NLP (lane 2), BSA (lane 3) or BSF (lane 4</xref>). These results reveal yet another pattern of antigenic reactivity not seen with the other antibodies.</p><p>Using three commercially available monoclonal NB antibodies (8D10, 5/3, and G1B8), we obtained similar reactivities against the same human antigens used earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18G, H, and I, lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>). These antibodies reacted with HSA present as a 68&#x02013;72 kDa band in the lanes corresponding to HS (lane 1 in all 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18G, H, and I</xref>), HS NLP (lane 2), and purified HSA (lane 3). Furthermore, all three monoclonal antibodies reacted with BSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18G, H, and I, lane 4</xref>), but not HRF (not shown). Virtually identical results were obtained with bovine antigenic material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18J</xref> shows a blot reacted with monoclonal antibody G1B8 while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18K</xref> shows reactivity with 8D10). Again, one single 66&#x02013;75 kDa band was seen in FBS (lane 1 for both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Fig. 18J and K</xref>), FBS NLP (lane 2), and BSA (lane 3), while BSF appeared as a lower band of 52&#x02013;65 kDa (lane 4). We were intrigued that none of these monoclonal antibodies seemed to detect fetuin-A in FBS or FBS NLP but they seemed to react strongly to both BSA and HSA, suggesting that the monoclonals used here may have indeed been derived against albumin and that they may be only weakly cross-reactive against fetuin-A. Together, these results suggest that all three monoclonal antibodies previously deemed specific for NB react in fact with HSA, BSA and BSF, demonstrating again multiple levels of immunological cross-reactivity that may form the basis for understanding why these antibodies may have reacted against human antigens, results which in turn have been misinterpreted as confirmatory of the presence of NB in diseased tissues.</p><p>The immunological cross-reactivities seen here were not restricted to protein reducing conditions only, as otherwise expected from earlier published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ruoslahti1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, similar antibody cross-reactivities were seen when proteins were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g018">Figure 18L and 18M</xref> for the monoclonal antibody specific for BSA (m-&#x003b1;-BSA) and the polyclonal antiserum specific for HSF (p-&#x003b1;-HSF). It is possible that the binding of these antigens to minerals may have resulted in conformational changes leading to the unfolding of primary sequences that in turn are reactive to antibodies even under non-reducing conditions.</p><p>The results seen here with NLP could be reproduced in their entirety with NB obtained from both FBS and HS as well as with the NB strains described earlier (data not shown). The results varied directly with the source of serum used for generating and maintaining NB. Accordingly, NB that had been propagated in serum-free medium showed progressively weaker antibody reactivities with prolonged incubation and serial passages before fading beyond detection (not shown).</p><p>Given the limited immunological cross-reactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ruoslahti1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> and low levels of homology known to exist between albumin and fetuin-A, we did not expect the multiple cross-reactivities seen here with antigens probed under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. However, the data shown here should explain an entire body of spurious results exemplified by the many immunological detection studies published earlier, including the puzzling and seeming contradictory findings with NB-specific monoclonal antibodies shown to react with both HSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Martel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and BSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results indicate that at least three distinct NB-specific monoclonal antibodies bind to epitopes shared by both albumin and fetuin-A. Since these two main serum proteins represent also the main constituents of NB, our results cast a new level of understanding with regards to what exactly previous immunostaining studies were detecting in human tissues.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref> lists the various human tissues, along with their underlying pathologies, in which NB had been detected either based on morphological criteria alone or by using antibodies claimed to be specific for NB. For reference, the antibodies along with the various immunostaining techniques used are included in the same table. Note that all the NB-detection studies listed out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref> have relied on culturing NB in FBS-containing medium and/or in medium alone. From the data presented here it should be obvious that, for some of the referenced studies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref> that relied solely on morphological criteria to infer the presence of NB in human specimens as well as a role for NB in human diseases, the evidence presented is glaringly insufficient. Still from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref>, it can be seen that &#x003b3;-FBS has been used for culturing NB in an increasing number of recent studies relying on the assumption that this irradiated serum no longer provides a source of new NB while still serving as a nutrient source for NB growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that &#x003b3;-irradiation at the high levels (30 kGy or more) used by NB researchers has a drastic effect on proteins by inducing their aggregation, fragmentation and ionization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Vuckovic1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, we would expect that such treatment would greatly reduce the biomineralization potential of FBS; thus, the results obtained with this system need to be viewed also with caution at this time.</p><p>As for the immunodetection studies listed out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref>, based on our own observations, it seems that, for NB cultures grown in the presence of FBS, the referenced studies had probably detected either BSA or BSF, or perhaps a combination of both. For serum-free cultures, the human counterparts of these same epitopes were presumably being detected; in such cases, it is also obvious that the initial seeding proteins would be diluted with each passage, until they would fade below detectable levels, as demonstrated by our own serial passage experiments. It is indeed problematic that antibodies deemed specific for NB should actually be detecting serum proteins not only of the same species but also across species. That is, several antibodies, including the ones used in our studies, were presumably derived against bovine NB but were also marketed as specific for human NB antigens, as claimed on their product specifications (Nanobac Oy). Besides the question of antigenic specificity, it is troublesome that antibodies reacting against protein epitopes present in the FBS (bovine origin) are being used to affirm the presence of human epitopes in diseased tissues, an unprecedented scenario that would question the validity of all the immunostaining studies published to date.</p><p>As an example, Khullar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Khullar1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004417-t002">Table 2</xref>, used polyclonal antiserum derived against NB originating from human kidney stones but that had been &#x0201c;grown&#x0201d; in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS. It is thus impossible to ascertain the nature as well as the species of the epitopes being detected in all such past NB preparations collected from human tissues but that had been maintained in culture medium containing FBS or &#x003b3;-FBS since any NB detected under such conditions would likely contain bovine antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Role of fetuin-A and albumin as both inhibitors and seeders of NB and NLP</title><p>Since both fetuin-A and albumin are known inhibitors of calcium biomineralization, we next sought to verify whether these same proteins can inhibit the formation of NLP. We first developed a simple turbidity assay based on the propensity of calcium, carbonate and phosphate to combine and form insoluble complexes that can be read at 650 nm by means of color spectrophotometry (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). Initial studies were met with variable results and wide margins of error which were corrected after the incubation times were properly controlled and the readings consistently done. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g019">Figure 19A</xref>, the concentrations of the various precipitating reactants (calcium, carbonate, and phosphate) could be conveniently adjusted and chosen to provide a dose-dependent reaction yielding a linear component stretching between 2 and 4 mM of calcium-carbonate-phosphate that could be used in turn to monitor the role of calcium-binding proteins. Based on these considerations, a final concentration of 3 mM was chosen for calcium, carbonate, and phosphate in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g019">Figure 19B</xref>, while the amount of BSF or HSA was varied. The inhibition achieved with BSF was much more pronounced and efficient than that seen with HSA. The protein concentration needed to obtain 50&#x00025; inhibition was estimated at 0.3 &#x000b5;M for BSF, compared to 6 &#x000b5;M for HSA. We found that Heiss et al. had earlier performed a comparable assay to study the formation of &#x0201c;calciprotein particles&#x0201d; that were obtained by mixing CaCl<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl and 140 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss3">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In their study, the concentration of bovine fetuin-A needed to obtain 50&#x00025; inhibition was estimated at 7.4 &#x000b5;M, which is significantly higher than what we obtained here. This difference may be attributed in part to the presence of carbonate ions in our reaction assay which, through their own binding to calcium, may have enhanced the inhibition seen with the added proteins. Since carbonate groups appear to constitute an important part of the NB scaffold, they were included in our assay so as to reproduce more precisely the NB phenomenology.</p><fig id="pone-0004417-g019" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004417.g019</object-id><label>Figure 19</label><caption><title>Inhibition of NLP formation by fetuin-A and albumin.</title><p>(A) NLP were prepared from 0.5 mM to 6 mM each of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> added to water.

With fetuin-A, precipitation was slower, becoming more pronounced after overnight incubation and which continued to increase for the next three days.

The initial inhibition demonstrated by the A<sub>650</sub> turbidity measurements appears to have been overcome after a period of incubation, and this lag time is shorter with albumin as compared with fetuin-A. These observations are in line with earlier studies with fetuin-A which demonstrated that this potent serum calcium phosphate inhibitor may also function as a nidus of calcium complex formation and mineralization when the same inhibition is overcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Heiss3">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, which would in turn explain the unusually high concentration of fetuin-A found in the bone matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Triffitt1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, while its absence in fetuin-A knocked-out mice is associated with ectopic calcification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Schafer2">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, two seemingly paradoxical findings that can be easily reconciled when the inhibition and seeding of calcium mineralization are seen as two sides of the same coin.

This was particularly noticeable with NLP derived from HS but was seen to vary with the serum lots used. The presence of lipid in NLP and NB was further suggested by the finding that apolipoprotein A1 is present in all the NLP and NB studied to date. Apolipoprotein A1 happens to be the primary protein constituent of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Frank1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, helping define the many physicochemical properties of HDL in the serum. Accordingly, lipids could be present either indirectly through the binding of apolipoprotein A1 to calcium phosphate complexes or directly through the binding of lipids to minerals, as proposed earlier by Cisar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Cisar1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, who demonstrated NB formation by inoculating pure phosphatidylinositol into DMEM without serum.</p><p>Preliminary lipid analysis using an enzymatic-colorimetric quantification method (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) revealed that NLP prepared from 1 ml of HS, diluted to 5&#x00025; in DMEM with 5 mM each of calcium, carbonate, and phosphate, gave a reading of 3 &#x000b5;g of triglycerides and 1 &#x000b5;g of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). No HDL or cholesterol could be detected. Similar assays done on NLP produced from 1 ml of FBS revealed 2 &#x000b5;g of triglycerides but no measurable LDL, HDL or cholesterol. The amount of triglycerides and LDL detected for the NLP here represents a small fraction of the lipids present in normal serum. If we take the upper limits of 1.5 mg of triglycerides and 1.0 mg of LDL per ml of HS as references, the data shown here for HS NLP would indicate that less than 0.2&#x00025; of the total triglycerides and less than 0.1&#x00025; of the LDL in HS were precipitated through NLP. Alternatively, by means of an agarose gel electrophoresis kit used routinely in clinical laboratories for determining the profiles of more common serum lipoproteins like HDL and LDL (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>), we could not obtain any detectable profiles. In contrast, untreated serum samples used as controls gave clear profiles that varied with the serum lots tested (not shown). It is not clear whether the low amounts of triglycerides and LDL detected here or the negative results seen with HDL may simply represent our own methodological limitations at this time since at least HDL would have been expected to be present given the presence of apolipoprotein A1 in all the NLP preparations studied to date. Still in this regard, it should be noted that our samples of human, but not bovine, NLP revealed consistently the presence of apolipoprotein B100, known structural component of LDL, which may explain the presence of detectable amounts of LDL and triglycerides in some of the assays performed for the human NLP. More definitive experiments are clearly needed to elucidate the lipid composition of these nanoparticles. The NB-seeding capability of the various lipid fractions found in normal serum must also be further determined. Given the structural basis already advanced here for the NB scaffold in terms of its protein and mineral composition, additional determinations can now be extended to encompass not only lipids but also nucleic acids, which we believe may also bind to NB leading in turn to the wide repertoire of ambiguous results reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, these results confirm our notion that the presumed NB nidi or seeds contained in the serum may in fact be simple calcium or apatite-binding factors. These factors tend to sequester calcium and/or calcium phosphate, preventing precipitation and, with it, unnecessary calcification. That is, these inhibitors bind to the crystal nucleus in order to prevent further crystallization, and by doing so, they modulate the formation of small, round nanoparticles earlier misconstrued to represent a new form of bacteria. As such, these inhibitors appear to be part of the normal homeostatic mechanisms deployed by the various body fluids to regulate calcium and calcium phosphate. In fact, inadvertent mineralization in humans is known to be carefully prevented by calcification inhibitor proteins such as fetuin-A, albumin, matrix-Gla protein, osteopontin, and osteoprotegerin, among others (reviewed in references 38 and 59). While all serum-related experiments have consistently shown the presence of the three major proteins albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A1, it is clear from this study that these proteins need not be exclusively present in all forms of NB, as demonstrated by the NB specimens obtained from other body fluids, which in fact revealed the presence of different proteins. The divergence in the proteins found associated with the various NB scaffolds studied here confirms further the notion that the presence of such proteins and the consequent formation of NB are probably circumstantial, depending merely on their availability in the local milieu. In fact, factors other than proteins may also be involved in generating NB as demonstrated through our trypsin-serum experiments. In this sense also, we raise caution concerning the use of the term &#x0201c;nanons&#x0201d; or fetuin-mineralo complexes to describe NB, as advanced by Raoult et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Raoult1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, since their use presumes the identification of a novel protein-related entity with pathogenic potential, which the authors suggested to be comparable to prions. In our own hands, not only is fetuin-A not always the major protein species when compared with albumin and apolipoprotein A1, but in our mind, these NB complexes represent simple bystander products produced through binding to calcium and apatite. In fact, results from the simple experiments shown here in our study can probably explain all the main findings reported in the NB literature, including the marked pleomorphism associated with NB.</p><p>NB have been described as potential pathogens with the ability to initiate extraskeletal calcification <italic>in vivo</italic>, and recent reports have flagged alarm concerning their widespread presence, filterability, self-replication, and blood-borne infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu1">&#x0005b;see for example refs. 4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Mathew1">&#x0005b;and 49&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous other studies have suggested a role for NB as causes for calcification-related pathologies, as exemplified by the formation of Randall's plaque in renal papillae deemed to be involved in the subsequent formation of kidney stones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu4">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> or atherosclerotic plaques in blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Miller1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. As sources of transmissible pathogenicity, NB have been deemed to satisfy in part the Koch postulates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ciftcioglu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Wang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Shiekh1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. In our view, however, a role for NB in pathogenesis, if any, is devoid of any substantive meaning unless NB can be defined chemically and structurally first, which we have sought to define here in this study. As pointed out by Urbano and Urbano in their clearly articulated and critical evaluation of the NB literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Urbano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, the same Koch postulates used earlier to substantiate the germ theory were predicated on well-defined biological cycles and structures advanced for the microbial pathogens in question, all of which are still lacking for NB. This uncertain scenario is compounded by the many immunostaining studies done in the past using antibodies that are now known to bind not only to antigenic epitopes of common serum proteins but that, even more seriously, may have inadvertently been used across species. That is, our study here shows that human NB were most likely being detected with antibodies raised against bovine albumin or fetuin-A, and likewise, NB presumably originating from human tissues will most likely acquire bovine antigens when the same tissue homogenates are transferred to FBS-containing medium. These considerations alone would probably render the entire body of NB literature using these reagents largely uninterpretable.</p><p>The results shown here suggest instead that the NB phenomenology is likely an epiphenomenon stemming from normal calcium homeostasis. That is, calcium-binding and inhibitory factors normally present in serum and other body fluids should bind to any excess calcium or apatite present in the medium, allowing the calcium-bounded complexes to be siphoned for clearance and body disposal. In this sense, the same inhibitory and seeding factors must be readily available in the serum as well as in the other body fluids. According to the mechanism proposed here, these same calcium-binding inhibitory factors, be them fetuin-A, albumin, or other binding factors, should sequester increasing amounts of calcium or apatite by binding to them, until saturation is reached, at which point the same inhibitory complexes would aggregate, become insoluble, and behave as seeds or nidi for further binding of apatite until microscopic NB are formed. In the case of <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture devoid of a proper clearance mechanism, these by-products would accumulate, thereby giving rise to the entire NB phenomenology. In retrospect, the original discovers of NB may have rediscovered the phenomenon of mineral or protein-mineral self-aggregation, which is probably ubiquitous in nature, as we and others have seen with calcium and silicate compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Martel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kirkland1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-GarciaRuiz2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The question remains whether this same phenomenology could in turn have any pathogenic implications for the body. In this respect, it would seem that any overt accumulation of unwanted debris could in principle generate deleterious effects on the body physiology, and the continuous accumulation of self-propagating protein-mineral complexes should not be viewed differently. Thus, the same inhibitory proteins deployed by the body to clear excess calcium or nascent apatite may also in principle serve as seeds or nidi for extraskeletal calcification, a notion supported by this study. At this juncture, we are impelled to turn to the insightful overview on calcium granulations written by Ryall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Ryall1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, who emphasizes through multiple examples that such calcium-deposit structures can be seen across a multitude of lifeforms in nature. Using the vast body of knowledge accumulated on calcium granulations, the same author questions whether similar bodies seen in human tissues, like Randall's plaques, are really the precursors of pathologies or perhaps, as she infers, they may represent innocuous or byproduct calcium deposits that are part of a more general calcium homeostatic and clearance cycle. In line with this reasoning, we also prefer to look at NB as simple calcium granulations deployed by the body as part of a normal calcium clearance mechanism that may have been inadvertently amplified through static cell cultures or in some body conditions which ended up turning the same inhibitory calcium complexes into seeds for apatite precipitation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Culture of NB</title><p>NB were isolated from human serum as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004417-Kajander2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The proteins were in-gel digested with sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (20 &#x000b5;g/ml; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. Peptides were extracted with 100&#x00025; ACN containing 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) formic acid and 0.5 &#x000b5;l of the peptides mixture was deposited on a MTP AnchorChip&#x02122; 600/384 TF (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS spectra were obtained with an Ultraflex TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Selected peaks were fragmented by the LIFT method to confirm the identity of the highest score protein by MS-MS analysis.</p><p>Alternatively, NLP samples were submitted to in-solution trypsin digestion.

NLP washed twice in DMEM and once in distilled water were successively reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin directly in solution, as described earlier. Peptides dried in a vacuum centrifuge were resuspended in 0.1&#x00025; formic acid (Sigma), loaded onto a reversed-phase liquid chromatography trap column (Zorbax 300SB-C18, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), and separated using a 10-cm analytical C<sub>18</sub> column (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) by eluting with a succession of different linear gradients of increasing concentration of elution buffer (99.9&#x00025; ACN containing 0.1&#x00025; formic acid). The liquid chromatography column was coupled to a 2-D linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap; Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated using the Xcalibur 2.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Both MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using one microscan with a maximum fill-time of 1000 and 100 ms for MS and MS/MS analysis, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Mass fingerprint analysis</title><p>Peptide masses were annotated with the FlexAnalysis 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics) with the following parameters: peak detection algorithm, SNAP; S/N threshold, 2; maximal number of peaks, 200. The resulting peak list was used for search against the non-redundant Swiss Prot database with the software BioTools 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics) and the MASCOT engine. The parameters used for the MASCOT search included carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidized methionine as fixed and variable modifications, respectively. One missed cleavage was allowed. Peptide masses corresponding to human keratins were excluded. The parameters for MS/MS analysis were similar to the ones mentioned above, except that the S/N threshold was set to 5, the maximum number of peaks allowed was 100, and the fragment tolerance was 0.6 Daltons. The criteria for positive protein identification included a score above the MASCOT threshold of chance expectation value (p&#x0003c;0.05), a molecular weight corresponding to the band obtained on the SDS-PAGE, and a confirmation of the highest score protein by MS/MS analysis of two selected peaks.</p><p>For in-solution trypsin digestion, the Scaffold software (version 2.1.03, Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate protein identification.

HSF (NCBI accession number NP-001613), BSF (NP-776409), HSA (AAA98797), and BSA (AAA51411) protein sequences were compared and aligned using the ClustalW program with default parameters. The similarity between non-identical amino acids was evaluated using the Gonnet sequence similarity matrix of the ClustalW program. Due to the differences in the length of the proteins compared, we used the shorter BSF as the reference sequence against which the three other sequences were aligned and compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g017">Fig. 17B</xref>). This type of juxtaposition resulted in interruption of sequences in HSF, BSA and HSA that were manually removed for purposes of showing identical or homologous sequences only. Thus, for these three other sequences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004417-g017">Figure 17B</xref>, the sequence metering shown for BSF does not apply.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) at 400 mA at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 hours. The membrane was blocked in 5&#x00025; defatted milk diluted in PBST buffer (PBS 1&#x000d7;, 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20) for 1 hour. The antibodies used were sheep polyclonal anti-BSF (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-BSA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), goat polyclonal anti-HSF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-NB antibodies 8D10, 5/3, and G1B8 (Nanobac Oy), and horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-sheep secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The three NB-specific monoclonal antibodies used were supposedly raised against bovine NB, but were also claimed to be specific for human antigens (Nanobac Oy). Primary antibodies were diluted 1&#x02236;1,000 in blocking solution and incubated with the membrane at 4&#x000b0;C overnight or at room temperature for 1 hour with orbital shaking. Membranes were washed for 5 minutes three times in PBST buffer. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1&#x02236;2,000 in blocking solution and incubated 1 hour at room temperature with shaking. The blots were revealed using the ECL western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The light signal was recorded by placing the membrane in contact with an autoradiographic film (Molecular Technologies, St-Louis, MO, USA) developed in a dark-room.</p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title>Inhibition of NLP formation by fetuin-A and albumin</title><p>NLP were prepared by successively adding aliquots of individual solutions of 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.25 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.25 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, all adjusted to pH 7.4, to water to final concentrations each ranging between 0 and 6 mM. The NLP solutions were prepared as before, and after transferring to transparent plastic cuvettes, the optical density of the solutions was monitored by reading the A<sub>650</sub> with a spectrophotometer. To prevent data scatter, all readings were done within the shortest possible period of time, through standardization of the handling steps, including the resident time allowed for the solution to sit in the cuvette prior to spectrophotometric reading (less than 10 seconds). We noticed that this resident time, if not properly controlled, was a source of wide margin of error, most likely due to the inherent variability seen with particle suspensions.</p><p>To test the effect of fetuin-A and albumin on the formation of NLP, each one of the precipitating reagents (CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) was added to a final concentration of 3 mM, within the linear range established for the assay. Stock solutions of BSF (purified from FBS; obtained from Sigma) or HSA (purified from HS; Sigma) were prepared in water at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. BSF and HSA were added to water, followed by vigorous shaking, prior to the addition of the precipitating reagents. BSF was added up to 20 &#x000b5;M while HSA was added up to 100 &#x000b5;M. All readings were done in triplicates. The background readings associated with BSF or HSA in water alone were subtracted from each data point prior to their final analysis; BSF gave much higher background readings than HSA. After spectrophotometric reading, the suspensions were stored either at room temperature or 4&#x000b0;C for various periods of time before further centrifugation, washing, and resuspension, as outlined earlier, and processed accordingly for ultra-microscopy or SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s3o"><title>Lipid composition of NLP</title><p>To verify whether lipids would bind to NLP, NLP were prepared by mixing sequentially solutions of 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.25 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.25 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, each at pH 7.4, with DMEM containing either 5&#x00025; FBS or 5&#x00025; HS. One ml FBS or HS was used. The precipitating ion groups were added each at a final concentration of 5 mM to a final volume of 20 ml.

The enzymatic-colorimetric methods used the 7600 Clinical Analyzer (Hitachi Science Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Triglycerides were measured using a lipase glycerol kinase enzymatic detection kit (Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA). Total cholesterol was measured using a cholesterol esterase/peroxidase enzymatic detection kit (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA, USA). HDL and LDL were measured using the cholesterol esterase/peroxidase enzymatic detection kits Cholestest&#x000ae;N HDL and Cholestest&#x000ae;N LDL (Sekisui Medical, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Lipoprotein profiles of FBS NLP and HS NLP were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using the SPIFE Lipoprotein detection kit (Helena, Beaumont, TX, USA). For agarose gel electrophoresis, 40 &#x000b5;l of FBS NLP or HS NLP resuspended in 25 mM EDTA were loaded on a 1&#x00025; agarose gel and electrophoresed for 40 minutes. After migration, lipoproteins were stained with Fat Red 7B stain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Dr. Chia C.
