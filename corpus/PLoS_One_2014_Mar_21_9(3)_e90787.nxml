We find that U.S. respondents value authentic items associated with individual persons (a sweater or an artwork) more than Indian respondents, but that both cultures value authentic objects not associated with persons (a dinosaur bone or a moon rock) equally. These differences cannot be attributed to more general cultural differences in the value assigned to authenticity. Rather, the results support the hypothesis that individualistic cultures place a greater value on objects associated with unique persons and in so doing, offer the first evidence for how valuation of certain authentic items may vary cross-culturally.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for publication has been provided by a research grant from the Immortality Project, administered by UC Riverside, to the first and last authors.

One explanation for this difference may be that Eastern collectors are simply less interested in U.S. celebrities. The current study, however, explores an alternative hypothesis that differences in the valuation of these items arise from more fundamental differences between individualist and collectivist cultures <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hofstede1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>In what is commonly referred to as the &#x0201c;extended-self hypothesis,&#x0201d; James, Belk and Dittmar <xref rid="pone.0090787-Belk1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090787-Dittmar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> suggest that people's self-concept goes beyond their physical body and cognitive processes to include all objects that they regard as &#x0201c;their own&#x0201d;&#x02014;their friends and family, pets, hobbies and the objects that they own and use. As such, Belk (1988) explains how we become &#x02018;contaminated&#x02019; in both positive and negative ways through contact with people's possessions (see also <xref rid="pone.0090787-Dittmar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090787-Argo2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). Recently, these notions of the extended-self and contamination (or, contagion) have been used to explain people's desire to own celebrity memorabilia in the West. Newman, Diesendruck and Bloom <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> demonstrate that consumers' valuation of celebrity memorabilia is explained by the belief that some immaterial quality or &#x02018;essence&#x02019; of the celebrity has been transferred to the object via physical contact. For example, individuals who are more sensitive to contagion express a stronger desire to own positive celebrity memorabilia, and a stronger repulsion from negative celebrity memorabilia. This work builds upon a larger literature on &#x0201c;magical thinking,&#x0201d; which has demonstrated belief in contagion in both primitive cultures <xref rid="pone.0090787-Frazer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and scientifically educated adults <xref rid="pone.0090787-Argo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Argo2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Rozin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090787-Subbotsky1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>However, the generalizability of the extended-self concept across cultures remains unclear. Past research has demonstrated that the importance that people place on the &#x0201c;self&#x0201d; may be greatly influenced by cultural factors. Markus and Kitayama <xref rid="pone.0090787-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090787-Kitayama1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> propose two forms of self-concept: an independent view of self, prominent in individualist countries such as the U.S., and an interdependent view of self, prominent in collectivist cultures such as those found across South and East Asia. Typically, the independent view of self seeks autonomy from others and reveres unique individualism, while the interdependent view of self is concerned with social cohesion and avoids favoritism <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hofstede1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Triandis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This difference in emphasis on the individual raises the question, if celebrity memorabilia is valued because of its connection to a unique person, will it be valued less in cultures that place less emphasis on individuals?</p><p>The current study reports data collected from North American (U.S.) and South Asian (Indian) respondents. On the bipolar dimension of collectivism-individualism <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hofstede1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the U.S. historically scores at the top of individualism scales (relative to all other countries), and India typically scores towards the collectivist end <xref rid="pone.0090787-Marriott1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090787-Verma2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

Respondents were told that an item was placed in a specialized machine that made an identical copy of it (no explanation was provided as to the mechanism). Respondents then estimated the value of the original and the duplicate. Between-subjects we varied the type of object: Half of the participants valued &#x0201c;contagion objects,&#x0201d; such as artworks or celebrity memorabilia, which previous research has tied to a belief in contagion <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The other half evaluated authentic items that are valued for reasons unconnected to individual persons. We hypothesized that if members of individualist cultures value &#x0201c;extensions of self&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0090787-James1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> more than members of collectivist cultures, U.S. respondents should value &#x0201c;contagion&#x0201d; originals more than Indian respondents, while both cultures should value other types of authentic objects roughly the same.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Two-hundred-and-forty-one adults (41% female, 118 U.S, 124 Indian) were recruited using Amazon's online Mechanical Turk (mTurk) service. mTurk is a database of over 100,000 users, who complete short tasks for monetary compensation <xref rid="pone.0090787-Buhrmester1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

This experiment was very similar to Experiment 1 except that respondents were told that the sweater belonged to their favorite living celebrity (rather than JFK) and we equated the value of all the original items ($10,000).

However, the difference in valuation between the original and copy of the contagion items was again significantly higher for U.S. than Indian respondents, Painting: <italic>t</italic>(156)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.77, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.01, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.2, Sweater: <italic>t</italic>(147)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.25, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.01, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.3. Thus, removing confounds associated with JFK and the different item values had no effect on the overall pattern of results. Both U.S. and Indian respondents valued authentic originals more than copies across items, but U.S. respondents valued the original contagion items significantly more than Indian respondents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>General Discussion</title><p>The primary goal of this paper was to explore how valuation of authentic items may vary as a function of culture. In the experiment and its replication, we found that U.S. respondents placed significantly more value than Indian respondents on authentic contagion items associated with individual persons. By comparison, no cultural differences were found for objects valued because of their distant origins (in time or space). This is consistent with the hypothesis that collectivist cultures are less focused on the individual and therefore place less monetary worth on authentic objects that are valued for their connections to particular individuals.</p><p>One concern might be that the currency of valuation (dollars) was kept the same across respondent groups. We did this because Frazier et al. <xref rid="pone.0090787-Frazier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> found that using local currencies left open the possibility that participants used the same anchor points (e.g. 1 million dollars or pounds) regardless of the difference of those amounts relative to each other, making comparison more difficult. Dollars are widely used in India so we expected that respondents would have a clear idea of what they were worth. Nevertheless, this raises the alternative possibility that cultural differences in valuation arose because a dollar in India will buy a great deal more than a dollar in the U.S. <xref rid="pone.0090787-World1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We argue that this alternative cannot explain the current results because 1) this should have been evident across the different object types (including distance objects), rather than just for the contagion items, and 2) in addition to the monetary value, we also asked about personal value (<italic>How much would you like to own the item</italic>) and social value (<italic>Does this item belong in a museum?</italic>) and these scores were correlated highly with the monetary valuation. If the difference in monetary valuation had been driven by a different concept of what a dollar was worth then we wouldn't expect non-monetary assessments of value to pattern in a similar manner.</p><p>An additional concern is that Indian respondents could have understood the paradigm differently from American respondents. For instance, they may have had a different concept of what was meant by a &#x0201c;perfect duplicate&#x0201d; &#x02013; for instance, Indian respondents may have thought the copy was generally less valuable than American respondents. However, the fact that there was no significant difference in respondents' valuation of the distance objects (the Dinosaur Bone and Moon Rock) suggests that both groups understood the paradigm in the same manner but valued the contagion objects differently.</p><p>We interpret the cultural difference in valuation of celebrity items as evidence that respondents from India attribute less value to items associated with particular individuals. A somewhat different explanation is that Indian respondents are, overall, simply less sensitive to the concept of contagion. There is some empirical evidence to reject this account &#x02013; for instance, Hejmadi, Rozin, &#x00026; Siegal <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hejmadi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> point out that contamination and purity constitute major themes in Hindu culture and showed that Hindu Indian children aged 4&#x02013;5 years are more sensitive to physical and spiritual contagion than equivalent American children, that they believe contamination is more indelible with regards to a range of sterilization procedures and that these biases become stronger with age. Meyer, Leslie, Gelman &#x00026; Stillwell <xref rid="pone.0090787-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> conducted a study examining American and Indian adults' beliefs with regards to contamination through surgical transplants. Meyer et al did not specifically target Hindu Indians and, like us, recruited participants using MTurk. Nonetheless, they found that Indian adults extend contamination concerns further than American adults. Measuring concerns about transplants from morally positive and negative donors, Indian respondents expressed greater concern about a range of items including a skin graft and a pacemaker while American concerns focused just on transplants of internal, biological items such as a heart. These findings suggest that contamination beliefs are, if anything, stronger in Indian populations than in American ones and therefore fail to explain the pattern of results in the current study.</p><p>Authentic items, such as celebrity memorabilia, do not usually differ aesthetically or functionally from inauthentic duplicates and yet (in the West) we often place greater value on them because of their historical connection to a time, place or person <xref rid="pone.0090787-Gelman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Rather than reflecting a lack of scientific education, there is increasing awareness that magical beliefs, such as valuing contagion, are an important part of everyday thought <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Frazier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hood3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Rosengren1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and arise early in the development of Western children <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Hejmadi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Frazier2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>The present experiments make two important contributions to this literature: Previous work has revealed that valuation of celebrity objects in the West is strongly motivated by contagion biases <xref rid="pone.0090787-James1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-Newman2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090787-OGuinn1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. To our knowledge, however, there has not been any previous attempt to examine whether this is culturally-specific. This paper provides the first empirical demonstration that contagion items are attributed greater monetary valuation in the West than in the East. Second, these results demonstrate that this difference is not driven by cultural differences in the value associated with originals (or authenticity) per se as both groups valued authentic items that were not connected to individual persons the same. Rather, the pattern of results suggests that items connected to individual persons are valued differently across the two cultures because individualism is valued more in the West than in the East and, by extension, so too are the objects that individuals own. These findings have important implications for our understanding of cultural variance in the extended-self concept and, more broadly, the psychological mechanisms underlying our preferences for authentic items.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to warmly thank Darren Julien for his correspondence.
