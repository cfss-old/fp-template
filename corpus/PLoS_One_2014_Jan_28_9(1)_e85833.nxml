In 2004, Aslam R. and Shiraki R. first determined that murine and human platelets express functional TLRs. Additionally, Andonegui G. demonstrated that platelets express TLR4, which contributes to thrombocytopenia. However, the underlying mechanisms of TLR4 expression by platelets have been rarely explored until now. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism of TLR4 expression underlying thrombin treatment. The human washed platelets were used in this study. According to flowcytometry and western blot analysis, the surface levels of TLR4 were significantly enhanced in thrombin-activated human platelets and decreased by TMB-8, calpeptin, and U73122, but not Y27632 (a Rho-associated protein kinase ROCK inhibitor) indicating that thrombin-mediated TLR4 expression was modulated by PAR/PLC pathway, calcium and calpain. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay demonstrated that the interaction between TLR4 and myosin-9 (a substrate of calpain) was regulated by calpain; cleavage of myosin-9 enhanced TLR4 expression in thrombin treated platelets. Transmission electron microscope data indicated that human platelets used &#x003b1;-granules to control TLR4 expression; the co-IP experiment suggested that myosin-9 did not coordinate with Rab7b to negatively regulate TLR4 trafficking in thrombin treated platelets. In summary, phospholipase C&#x003b3;-calpain-myosin 9-Rab7b axis was responsible for the mechanism underlying the regulation of TLR4 containing &#x003b1;-granules trafficking in thrombin-stimulated platelets, which was involved in coagulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Council (NSC 97-2314-B-038-035-MY2, NSC 101-2314-B-038-041-MY3 and NSC 101-2314-B-016-007-MY2) and partial by the National Defense Medical Center (TSGH-C98-25), Taiwan.

These anucleate megakaryocyte fragments have the ability to rapidly localize to sites of injury and infection where they release mediators that regulate inflammation and immune progression <xref rid="pone.0085833-Weyrich1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Platelets contain stores of cytokines and mediators within their &#x003b1;- and dense-granules that are released upon stimulation. Platelets can also bind to and internalize bacteria and viruses through engulfing, endosome-like vacuoles that fuse with platelet &#x003b1;-granules and allow granular proteins access to the pathogen <xref rid="pone.0085833-Youssefian1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs), homologs of the Drosophila protein Toll <xref rid="pone.0085833-Rock1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, are pattern recognition receptors that mediate cellular responses to a large array of microbial ligands <xref rid="pone.0085833-Andonegui1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Currently, more than 10 different TLRs have been identified; among these TLR4 is a receptor for gram-negative bacteria, LPS, and some viruses. TLR4 is expressed in many different cell types, including dendritic cells, neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0085833-Abreu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085833-Tavener1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recently, both human and murine platelets have been shown to express functional TLR4 <xref rid="pone.0085833-Aslam1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085833-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, indicating that the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway may contribute to cellular effects in platelets. An additional <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrates that LPS accelerates thrombin/collagen-induced aggregation in platelets and that this is mediated by TLR4 expression <xref rid="pone.0085833-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Data from <italic>in vivo</italic> assays also show that circulating platelet counts fall precipitously during sepsis and that the degree of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of sepsis <xref rid="pone.0085833-Aslam1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085833-Jayachandran1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, platelet counts are decreased under septic conditions due to well-established migration into the lungs and liver <xref rid="pone.0085833-Stohlawetz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Andonegui <italic>et al.</italic> have demonstrated that TLR4 on platelets is essential for platelet migration into the lungs using adoptive transfer of wild-type or TLR4-deficient platelets into wild-type or LPS-treated mice <xref rid="pone.0085833-Andonegui1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It had been reported that platelet TLR4 activates neutrophil extracellular traps to ensnare bacteria in septic situation <xref rid="pone.0085833-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Interestingly, extracellular histones promote thrombin generation through the TLR4 on platelets <xref rid="pone.0085833-Semeraro1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, platelet TLR4 is proposed to have important roles in platelet function, including platelet adhesion and migration, as well as attraction and destruction. Platelets may also mediate inflammation, immune and aggregation progression via TLR4. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in regulation of TLR4 expression on the surface of platelets are still unclear and remain to be explored. Therefore, we used healthy washed human platelets to examine the expression of TLR4 in thrombin-stimulated platelets in this study and explored its underlying mechanisms <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Preparation of Washed Human Platelets</title><p>Washed platelets were isolated from health male human whole blood by previously described methods <xref rid="pone.0085833-Freedman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085833-Oda1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The mechanisms involved in the regulation of TLR4 expression on the surface of resting or activated platelets are as yet unclear and remain to be studied. Flow cytometry using a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled mouse anti-human polyclonal TLR4 antibody was performed to determine whether surface expression of TLR4 is increased in activated platelets. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085833-g001">figure 1A</xref>, TLR4 fluorescence intensity on the surface of platelets was increased (right shift) in the thrombin-activated group compared with the resting na&#x000ef;ve group. Furthermore, stimulation with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 U/mL thrombin significantly increased the expression of TLR4 in a dose-dependent manner relative to that of the untreated control group (279.56&#x000b1;74.72%, 263.12&#x000b1;79.16% and 263.75&#x000b1;34.07% of control, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085833-g001">figure 1B</xref>). The stimulation of thrombin did not significantly increase the total TLR4 expression in human platelets. The effects caused by thrombin were further supported by western blot analysis of membrane-bound TLR4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085833-g001">figure 1C</xref>). Previous studies using antagonists or antibodies that block PAR1 and PAR4 activation had indicated that PAR1 mediates human platelet activation at low thrombin concentrations, whereas PAR4 contributes to thrombin-induced platelet activation at high thrombin concentrations <xref rid="pone.0085833-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085833-Brass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

This granule secretion is mainly regulated by the cytoskeletal signaling pathway; accordingly, the cytoskeleton may increase their hydrolysis and reorganization. There are many types of proteases with potential roles in the assembly and stability of cytoskeletal signaling complexes. This signaling may result in the association of the receptor with the cytoskeleton, phosphorylation of proteins, an increase in intracellular calcium level, and activation of calpain <xref rid="pone.0085833-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The calpain play important roles in physiological activation of platelets.

Recent evidence demonstrated that thrombocytopenia may result from mutations in filamin A <xref rid="pone.0085833-Nurden1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In the future, it will be important to explore the impact of filamin A on TLR4 expression during the process of platelet activation.</p><p>Our results highlight the important roles of phospholipase C<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> and calcium-dependent calpain activation in TLR4 expression in thrombin-stimulated platelets. We also explored novel roles for myosin-9 and Rab7b in platelet TLR4 expression through its interaction with TLR4. These primary data indicate a likely mechanism for thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation and TLR4 expression and also provides a basis for further investigation of TLR4 modulation as a therapeutic strategy for coagulopathy and platelet disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mr. Tze-Liang Yang and Mrs. Min-Yu Lo for technical
