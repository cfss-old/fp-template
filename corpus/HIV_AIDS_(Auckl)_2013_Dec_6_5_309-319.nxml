In Africa, there are limited studies that specifically investigated immunological recovery, while some had varying definitions for complete immunological recovery contrary to studies in Europe and North America, where immunological recovery was consistently defined as attaining 500 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L. This study aimed at investigating the effect of baseline CD4 cell counts on ART-outcome measures among HIV-infected Ugandans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The overall objective of the study was to investigate a relationship between HIV severity as measured by baseline CD4 count and ART outcomes among ART-na&#x000ef;ve Ugandans.

The JCRC is a private HIV/ART centre that had been providing ARVs for at least 10 years by the time of the study. The HIV center at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, which is run by Uganda&#x02019;s Ministry of Health in partnership with the JCRC and Makerere-Mbarara Joint University program, had been providing ART for at least 5 years. Both sites follow the national guidelines and protocol for ART initiation and HIV/ART management, including CD4 T-cell enumeration.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data collection</title><p>Records belonging to HIV-seropositive Ugandans who initiated treatment between January 2002 and June 2007 were reviewed from Mbarara Hospital in Western Uganda, and the JCRC in Central Uganda. Records were excluded if they lacked baseline CD4 counts, were ART-experienced by the time of the patient&#x02019;s referral to the study site, were reported as having inadequate adherence, or had one CD4 data point in a year. Data collected included clinical events, CD4 counts, and hematology readings, and these were recorded from time of ART initiation until the visit prior to data collection.

We observed some inconsistencies in the timing of immunological evaluation, with some data not collected at the expected 6-month time points. In order to get an all-inclusive analysis, we opted to assess absolute CD4 cell increase for the period 0&#x02013;6 months and then during 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years instead of assessing at the end of each 6-month period. The latter option was leading to significant loss of data. We also modeled this data to see the predicted average increase in absolute CD4 cell counts over time for the study population, while considering their immunological status at the time of treatment initiation. A random-coefficient model based on fractional polynomials with correlated random effects was employed. The best-fit model was of second-degree fractional polynomial functions of time adjusted by CD4 T cells at baseline (only two baseline CD4 categories were considered &#x02013; &#x0003c;200 and &#x02265;200 &#x02013; for this model). Normality of the CD4 T-lymphocyte values was achieved by log<sub>10</sub> transformation of data. Of factors that were considered for the model, sex and site were shown to influence the rate of CD4 cell recovery, while age and ART regimen showed no significant effect. In the final model, therefore, the average increase in absolute CD4 cell counts over time was modeled for the patients of the baseline CD4 cell category (&#x0003c;200 and &#x02265;200 cells/&#x003bc;L), taking sex and site as covariates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis for complete immunological recovery</title><p>Although several studies in Europe and North America considered immunological recovery at 500 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L, we considered a value of 418 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L, based on a previous study that documented a CD4 reference range of 418&#x02013;2,105 cells/&#x003bc;L for the study population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-hiv-5-309">34</xref> Using Stata software, the incidence rates of reaching 418 CD4 cells during 1,000 personal years of follow-up on ART were calculated for the study population and also compared between patients with baseline CD4 cell counts &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x003bc;L versus patients with baseline CD4 cell counts &#x02265;200 cells/&#x003bc;L. The incidence rates of immunological recovery were calculated by dividing the number of patients with complete immunological recovery (attained &#x02265;418 cells/&#x003bc;L) in each baseline CD4 cell category by the total person-years of observation contributed by all of the patients in that category. For each patient, the person-time of observation was calculated from the date of ART initiation until the date with the first CD4 cell measurement &#x02265;418 cells/&#x003bc;L or the date of last clinical and laboratory evaluation. The incidence rates during 1,000 personal years of follow-up on HAART were then obtained by multiplying the incidence rates obtained for each baseline CD4 cell category by 1,000 personal years of follow-up. The incidence rates of new clinical events were calculated in the same manner. Rate ratios were obtained by dividing the incidence rates of the two baseline CD4 cell categories.</p><p>The cutoff level of 200 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L was emphasized in the analysis of immunological recovery, based on the fact that it was the WHO reference for initiating HAART at the time of the study. However, following our observation of a baseline interquartile range (IQR) of 41&#x02013;184 CD4 cells for this studied group, and the implications of very low baseline CD4 cell counts, other comparison cutoff points, including 50 and 100 cells/&#x003bc;L, were employed. An additional CD4 cutoff level of 250 cells/&#x003bc;L was used during the analysis, since the country was considering treating all HIV patients &#x0003c;250 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L.</p></sec><sec><title>Incidence rates of new clinical events</title><p>Using the same software and baseline CD4 cell cutoff points that were employed for complete immunological recovery, the incidences rates of new clinical events during 1,000 personal years of follow-up on HAART were calculated per CD4 cell category. It was difficult in some cases to differentiate AIDS-defining from non-AIDS-defining illness just based on the records. We therefore opted to include all the clinical events that happened during the follow-up period, rather than trying to analyze for new AIDS-defining illnesses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All 5,200 patients&#x02019; files at the selected sites were reviewed to extract 426 HIV-positive subjects who started treatment during the specified period and fulfilled all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The 426 patients had a total of 2,787 visit records, yielding 1,061.1 person years on HAART. However, CD4 T-lymphocyte evaluation was done at only 1,635 visits, while the remaining visits were clinical visits where CD4 cell evaluation was deemed unnecessary by the clinician or unaffordable by the patients. The majority of the records (63.2%) were from the JCRC, and 68.3% of all records belonged to female patients. Median baseline CD4 was 109 cells/&#x003bc;L (IQR 41&#x02013;184), with no difference observed in baseline characteristics between the two sites. Baseline characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-5-309">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Ninety-four percent of all patients were initiated on drugs that are recommended for first-line regimens, and the drugs included zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T), efavirenz (Efv), nevirapine (NVP) and lamivudine (3TC). The most common regimen consisted of zidovudine/stavudine/nevirapine, and it was prescribed to 52.4% of the patients. Although replace ments between first-line drugs occurred during the follow-up period, the majority of the patients were still on first-line regimens by the time of data collection. The second-line ARV drugs that were prescribed to patients included didanosine, tenofovir, emtricitabine and lopinavir/ritonavir (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-5-309">Table 1</xref>). Although all patients required treatment according to WHO recommendations, 79.3% were initiated on ART because their CD4 cell counts were below 200 cells/&#x003bc;L, while the remaining 20.7% were initiated on treatment because of a World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) clinical stage III/IV diagnosis despite their CD4 counts being &#x02265;200 cells/&#x003bc;L.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results related to CD4 cell increase over time</title><p>Although all the studied patients required ART in accordance with WHO recommendations for resource-limited settings, we observed a difference in the rate and extent of CD4 recovery, depending on whether they started treatment when they were above or below the 200 CD4 cell mark that was recommended then by the WHO. Although the rate of CD4 cell raise was not uniform at any two given periods, a biphasic raise in CD4 T- lymphocytes was observed for patients in both CD4 cell categories (&#x0003c;200 and &#x02265;200 cells/&#x003bc;L). In both cases, the average CD4 cell increase was faster during the first year of treatment. Patients with baseline CD4 counts &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x003bc;L had a much faster average increase of 25 CD4 cells per month during the first 6 months of treatment, but this dropped to an average of seven cells per month in the following 6 months. On the contrary, the average monthly increase for patients with baseline CD4 counts &#x02265;200 cells/&#x003bc;L was maintained between nine and 12 cells throughout the first year of treatment. Modeling of the data for the two groups predicted a better overall CD4 cell recovery for patients who started treatment at &#x02265;200 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003). These results are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-hiv-5-309">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-hiv-5-309">Figure 1</xref>. There were insignificant CD4 cell increments during the second to fourth years of treatment.</p><p>The rate and extent of CD4 recovery also differed by sex and site. Female patients demonstrated a faster CD4 increase and reached higher CD4 cell levels compared to male patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0005), and CD4 increase was faster among patients from Mbarara Hospital compared to the JCRC (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0107). Typically log<sub>10</sub>-transformed data in a random-coefficient model with fractional polynomials demonstrated a difference between the highest predicted CD4 cell values attainable by female patients who started ART with CD4 &#x0003e; 200 cells/&#x003bc;L at the Mbarara site and the highest attainable by male patients who initiated treatment below 200 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L from the JCRC, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-hiv-5-309">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of baseline CD4 cell count on immunological recovery and clinical events</title><p>Only 37.1% of the patients attained the target CD4 count of 418 cells/&#x003bc;L. The median baseline CD4 count for the 62.9% nonresponders was 86 cells/&#x003bc;L (IQR 34&#x02013;155), while the median CD4 count for the complete responders was 142 cells/&#x003bc;L (IQR 72&#x02013;212). Analysis of the data to include additional baseline CD4 levels of 50, 100, and 250 cells/&#x003bc;L showed a positive correlation between baseline CD4 counts and immunological recovery and a negative correlation with new clinical events. Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-hiv-5-309">Table 3</xref> show that patients with baseline CD4 counts of &#x02265;100 cells/&#x003bc;L reached the targeted 418 CD4 count 2.16 times faster compared to patients initiating treatment of &#x0003c;100 CD4 cells/&#x003bc;L.

Analysis of clinical data from two HIV centers in Uganda showed that patients who started HAART with higher CD4 counts had better chances of immunological recovery after starting ART, and they had a lower incidence of new clinical events. Overall, 37.1% of all patients had complete immunological recovery, and the median baseline CD4 count for the complete responders was higher than that of incomplete responders. Differences in rates of increase of CD4 T- lymphocytes were observed as a function of time between the two study sites at the different geographical locations, and female patients attained higher CD4 counts than male patients treated over the same period.</p><p>Studies have previously demonstrated poor immunological recovery with low baseline CD4 counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-hiv-5-309">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-hiv-5-309">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-hiv-5-309">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-hiv-5-309">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-hiv-5-309">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-hiv-5-309">33</xref> The proportion of patients (37.1%) who achieved complete immunological recovery is much lower than that reported in other cohorts, including the 69% who recovered immunologically in the Swiss cohort.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-hiv-5-309">7</xref> This could have been due to a low median baseline CD4 count for patients in our cohort compared to the American and European cohorts, again emphasizing the effect of poor immunological recovery with advanced HIV. A biphasic raise in CD4 cells during HAART has been reported from other studies, with the initial phase being faster than the subsequent increments, and the increment being faster among patients starting with low CD4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-hiv-5-309">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-hiv-5-309">30</xref> Though different studies have reported differences in the length of these two phases, Lederman observed an initial raise occurring in 8&#x02013;12 weeks that is thought to follow redistribution of CD4 cells from lymphoid tissues, while the second phase was characterized by a steady increase in na&#x000ef;ve CD4 and CD8 cells, reflective of enhanced thymic function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-hiv-5-309">18</xref> No significant increase in CD4 cell counts was observed after the first year of treatment for the study population, and this may imply poor thymic function following ART initiation in advanced HIV among our study patients.</p><p>Our observation of average CD4 cell increase of 150 cells/&#x003bc;L and 192 cells/&#x003bc;L at 6 and 12 months, respectively, for patients with baseline CD4 &#x0003c; 200 cells/&#x003bc;L is comparable to that reported in other east African countries. An average increase of 169 and 208 cells/&#x003bc;L was reported for Kenyan patients at 6 and 12 months, respectively, during the study period 2004&#x02013;06,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-hiv-5-309">13</xref> while a Tanzanian cohort that was treated from 2003 to 2006 had a median increase of 163 cells/&#x003bc;L after 12 months on ART.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-hiv-5-309">1</xref> The study populations from the east African reports were similar in baseline CD4 characteristics in having large proportions of patients who initiated treatment at CD4 &#x0003c; 200 cells/&#x003bc;L (77.6% and 79.1% for Kenya and Uganda, respectively). These studies also demonstrated the failure of patients with low baseline CD4 to attain full CD4 recovery. Unlike other cohorts that reported significant CD4 cell increase at 3&#x02013;4 years after starting treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-hiv-5-309">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-hiv-5-309">18</xref> our study population showed no significant CD4 cell increases beyond the first year of treatment. This effect may be due to the fact that the majority of these patients (77.6%) started below 200 cells/&#x003bc;L and the earlier studies reported poorer response among patients with low CD4 counts, and possibly poor thymic function. Research has also previously described a high proportion of HIV-infected hematopoietic microvascular endothelial cells among patients with advanced HIV, a poor response by these infected cells to stimuli,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-hiv-5-309">20</xref> and exhaustion of T cells within the bone marrow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-hiv-5-309">19</xref></p><p>For the benefit of the country, however, this study gives an update on when patients started treatment. Weidle et al reported patients to have initiated treatment with median baseline CD4 cell count of 70 (15&#x02013;183) between 1998 and 2000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-hiv-5-309">12</xref> This study reports a median baseline CD4 of 109 (41&#x02013;184) for Ugandan HIV-infected patients who were treated from 2002 to 2007 and median CD4 cell count of 131 (57&#x02013;196) for patients who started treatment in the year 2006 alone. The increase in median baseline CD4 over the years may be attributed to improved access to HIV/ART care and increasing knowledge in HIV care.</p><p>Although we found it difficult to analyze for the effect of delayed treatment on new AIDS-defining diagnoses, we report a slow but steady reduction in overall new clinical events at increasing baseline CD4 counts during the observational period, although no statistical differences were detected between the two groups. This could be directly related to the poor CD4-recovery rate, and hence a poorer immunological protection for patients who started treatment late, and the failure to detect statistical differences between the two groups could be due to the weakness of the tool used. Availability and use of AIDS-defining illnesses may have yielded different results.</p><p>Although effect of sex on ART outcomes is poorly documented, Johannessen et al reported an association between male sex and mortality in a univalent analysis for a Tanzanian<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-hiv-5-309">1</xref> cohort who received ART from 2003 to 2006. On the contrary, young male patients from American and European cohorts were reported by Bosch et al to have demonstrated a higher average CD4 cell increase after 144 weeks of ART according to an AIDS Clinical Trials Group study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-hiv-5-309">24</xref> There is, however, a huge difference in sex-related demographics, with men representing 82.1% of Bosch et al&#x02019;s study population, while men constituted 30.3% and 31.7% in the Tanzanian and Ugandan studies, respectively. This discrepancy in sex proportions may have contributed to the differences observed in the relationship between sex and ART response.</p><p>Although our study sites had no differences in baseline CD4 characteristics and HIV/ART management, patients from Mbarara Hospital demonstrated a faster rate of CD4 cell increase compared to JCRC patients, and it is difficult to explain this observation. The JCRC is more experienced at HIV/ART management given the time period the center has been providing treatment, and we would have expected better outcomes at this site. However, we earlier described how geographic demographics affect CD4 T-lymphocyte cell counts when we reported healthy volunteers from Mbarara having lower mean CD4 cells compared to the Kampala population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-hiv-5-309">34</xref> In that previous report, we expressed that individuals with previously high-normal CD4 values may present with falsely high-enough CD4 values in comparison to the national cutoff points for treatment initiation, and we recommended an integration of the knowledge of patients&#x02019; socioeconomic and health histories in populations with wide CD4 reference ranges. Uganda is a country with a wide CD4 reference range, and patients from Mbarara may have started at an advantage of a better CD4 cell count, given their inherently lower normal CD4 reference than Kampala patients.</p><p>Our study had limitations, including the fact that the study had a wide study period (January 2002&#x02013;June 2007). HIV/ART care could have improved with time, and this effect may have affected interpretation of our results. Difficulties in getting specific diagnoses from the records limited our analysis to general clinical events, and hence conclusions regarding new AIDS illnesses and adverse drug reactions could not be made. Furthermore, the lack of systematic periodic CD4 cell assessments for some of the studied patients disabled data assessment at specific periods, which is a major flaw in this study.</p><p>Nonetheless, these data represent day-to-day HIV/ART management in a resource-limited setting, and they were still considered very representative of what the true ART outcomes are in these settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and recommendation</title><p>Findings from our study show poor immunological recovery following delayed ART, which could be indicative of possible dysfunction of the microvascular endothelial cells of the bone marrow. We also report differences in immunological recovery with respect to sex and geographical locations, a finding that we related to population variations in CD4 reference values. We recommend early ART initiation to prevent prolonged destruction of the microvascular endothelial cells. Treatment started at the CD4 cell count of &#x0003c;500 cells/&#x003bc;L proposed in the current WHO guidelines, or even earlier, might result in better immunological recovery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Program as a part of a PhD project under a collaboration between the Karolinska Institute and Makerere University.
