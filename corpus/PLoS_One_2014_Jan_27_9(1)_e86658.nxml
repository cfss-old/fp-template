Usually, antigens are produced in yeast then purified and mixed with adjuvants before immunization. However, the purification costs and the safety concerns recently raised by the use of new adjuvants argue for alternative strategies. To this end, the use of whole yeast as both production and delivery system appears attractive. Here, we evaluated <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> yeast as an alternative vaccine production and delivery system for the circumsporozoite protein (CS) of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the etiologic agent of malaria. The CS protein from <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (<italic>Pb</italic>) was selected given the availability of the stringent C57Bl/6 mouse model of infection by <italic>Pb</italic> sporozoites, allowing the evaluation of vaccine efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>. PbCS was multimerized by fusion to the measles virus (MV) nucleoprotein (N) known to auto-assemble in yeast in large-size ribonucleoprotein rods (RNPs). Expressed in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, the N-PbCS protein generated highly multimeric and heterogenic RNPs bearing PbCS on their surface. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analyses revealed the shape of these RNPs and their localization in peripheral cytoplasmic inclusions. Subcutaneous immunization of C57Bl/6 mice with heat-inactivated whole <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expressing N-PbCS RNPs provided significant reduction of parasitemia after intradermal challenge with a high dose of parasites. Thus, in the absence of accessory adjuvants, a very low amount of PbCS expressed in whole yeast significantly decreased clinical damages associated with <italic>Pb</italic> infection in a highly stringent challenge model, providing a proof of concept of the intrinsic adjuvancy of this vaccine strategy. In addition to PbCS multimerization, the N protein contributed by itself to parasitemia delay and long-term mice survival. In the future, mixtures of whole recombinant yeasts expressing relevant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigens would provide a multivalent formulation applicable for antigen combination screening and possibly for large-scale production, distribution and delivery of a malaria vaccine in developing countries.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was funded by the &#x0201c;Transversal Research Project&#x0201d; from the Institut Pasteur (PTR365).

Although only a few adjuvants are licensed <xref rid="pone.0086658-FDA1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, a large array of chemical-based new adjuvants or immunostimulants for vaccine antigens are currently developed <xref rid="pone.0086658-Ribeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, several concerns about the safety of using chemicals in association with vaccines are raised <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bagnoli1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Tomljenovic1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Francois1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Piyasirisilp1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, alternative delivery strategies need to be developed. Among them, the use of attenuated <xref rid="pone.0086658-Lacerda1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> or inactivated <xref rid="pone.0086658-Stubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Roohvand1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bian1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> yeast is emerging. Yeast-based vaccines elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the absence of adjuvants <xref rid="pone.0086658-Stubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Roohvand1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bian1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Saiki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Heat-killed yeasts have been shown to protect mice against systemic aspergillosis and coccidioidomycosis <xref rid="pone.0086658-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, or to provide sterile protection to chicken towards infectious bursal disease <xref rid="pone.0086658-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recombinant yeasts are currently developed as vaccine candidates against HBV and HCV in humans <xref rid="pone.0086658-Haller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or leukemia <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bui1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Whole yeasts activate dendritic cells (DCs) and are efficiently taken up through fungipods or phagocytic synapses on DCs <xref rid="pone.0086658-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Goodridge1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Both mannose and Dectin-1 receptors mediate the interaction between human DCs and the most biotechnologically relevant yeasts: <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<italic>P.pastoris</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bazan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. DCs can distinguish direct fungal contacts from soluble fungal-derived components through the Dectin-1 pattern-recognition receptor <xref rid="pone.0086658-Goodridge1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, activated DCs become potent presenting-cells for antigens expressed in recombinant yeast, and efficiently deliver antigens into both MHC class I and class II pathways. Hence, yeast-DC interplay provides a strong adjuvant effect on antigen immunogenicity <xref rid="pone.0086658-Stubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Roohvand1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bian1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Saiki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Multimerization of monomeric antigens was also largely demonstrated to amplify their immunogenicity through increased uptake by DCs <xref rid="pone.0086658-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Storni1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, combining the antigen multimerization with expression in whole yeast would be even more advantageous. Several multimeric proteins, generally from viral origin, have been used as delivery systems <xref rid="pone.0086658-Casares1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Vietheer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Jariyapong1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The nucleoprotein (N) of measles virus (MV), which composes the viral helical nucleocapsid <xref rid="pone.0086658-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086658-Griffin2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, has the capacity to auto-assemble around any RNA molecule in the cytoplasm of cells in which this protein is expressed (mammalian <xref rid="pone.0086658-Bourhis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, bacterial <xref rid="pone.0086658-Warnes1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> or yeast <xref rid="pone.0086658-Slibinskas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>) with a ratio of 1 N molecule to 6 ribonucleotides. This gives rise to helical, highly stable, and multimeric ribonucleoprotein rods (RNPs) similar in shape and diameter to RNPs present in MV viral particles <xref rid="pone.0086658-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The expression of MV-N protein in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> GS115 yeast strain induces the formation of high amounts of these RNPs visible in the cytoplasm by electron microscopy <xref rid="pone.0086658-Slibinskas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, whole recombinant yeast expressing MV-N appears as a promising delivery system for multimerizing vaccine antigens.</p><p>Currently tested whole yeast-based vaccine candidates are based on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast. In 2009 the entire genome of <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yeast (GS115 strain) was sequenced <xref rid="pone.0086658-DeSchutter1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This encouraged the development of <italic>P. pastoris</italic> as bioreactor in vaccinology. Indeed, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> offers many advantages compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, such as the stringent control of protein production through a strong inducible promoter and the reduced length of the oligosaccharide chains eventually added post-translationally to transgenic proteins. Moreover, terminal <italic>alpha-</italic>1,3 glycan linkages on glycosylated proteins, which are responsible for hyper-antigenicity effects of antigens produced in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0086658-Cregg1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, are not formed in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>.</p><p>To evaluate a new vaccine platform based on recombinant whole yeast as antigen delivery vector for multimerized antigens, we used a malaria animal model. Despite major research efforts, an efficient malaria vaccine is still not available <xref rid="pone.0086658-Daily1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Hence, it is worthwhile to investigate new approaches. Malaria is caused by the multiplication of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in the blood after injection in the skin by a mosquito. The parasite form in the skin, called sporozoite, invades hepatocytes to develop into red blood cell (RBC) infecting forms, during the pre-erythrocytic phase of infection <xref rid="pone.0086658-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

In RTS,S, CS multimerization is achieved by its association to hepatitis B virus-like particles.</p><p>Here, CS multimerization is obtained by fusing the CS from <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (<italic>Pb</italic>) ANKA strain (a rodent-infective species) to the N protein from MV. We generated recombinant <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yeast expressing N or PbCS alone, or N-PbCS RNPs, and characterized the size, shape and cellular localization of these RNP structures.

In this model, most animals die during the first 10 days post infection presenting symptoms of experimental cerebral malaria, or later as a consequence of extreme red blood cell infection <xref rid="pone.0086658-Craig1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Following subcutaneous immunization with whole yeast expressing N-PbCS RNPs then intradermal challenge with <italic>Pb</italic> sporozoites, the onset of blood infection was significantly delayed, and animal survival was prolonged.

Induction of N-PbCS in GS115 and KM71 strains resulted in the rapid degradation of the fusion protein (data not shown), while the full-length fusion protein was correctly produced in SMD1168 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The maximum expression of N-PbCS was obtained at 54 h after induction. In the best N-PbCS expressing clone selected by qualitative and quantitative western blot, the expression level of fusion protein (12 ng/YU) was 73 times lower than N alone (871 ng/YU) in the same strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086658-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

Although N multimerization may impact the affinity of RNPs of different size for anti-N antibodies used for quantification, a comparison of N amounts can be performed among fractions at similar levels in N and N-PbCS samples. For both recombinant yeasts, the profile of N and N-PbCS distribution on sucrose showed the presence of monomeric or oligomeric N in the upper fractions, multimeric forms in the middle fractions and highly multimeric RNPs in the pellets. Notably, we estimated by calculation routine (see Materials and Methods) that RNPs present in the pellets were heavier than 36,502 kDa, assembling more than 628 N molecules. The 2-log difference in read out between the two recombinant yeasts relates to the 2-log difference in N expression level between N and N-PbCS yeasts (871 ng/YU versus 12 ng/YU).</p><fig id="pone-0086658-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0086658.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ELISA quantification of N or PbCS proteins in ultracentrifugation (U) fractions and pellets of SMD1168 lysates expressing N alone at 871 ng/YU (A) or N-PbCS at 12 ng/YU (B).</title><p>Yeast cultures, lysates and ultracentrifugations were performed in duplicate (3 U and 4 U for N expressing yeast, and 5 U and 6 U for N-PbCS yeast).

Quantitative western blot analysis of N-PbCS pellets demonstrated that RNPs were mainly constituted of N (70&#x02013;80%) and that full length N-PbCS protein represented 10&#x02013;20% of total N. In addition, recombinant RNPs contained 10% of degraded N-PbCS proteins (data not shown). The imbalanced profile of N-PbCS yeast may be due to RNP pull down by interaction of PbCS antigen with subcellular elements or alternatively to RNPs stabilization by N-PbCS fusion resulting in highly multimeric RNPs. Heterologous antigen expression did not modify yeast RNA and TSP patterns as compared to wild type yeasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086658.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

In the N recombinant SMD1168 yeast, we found numerous RNPs with herringbone shape of 20&#x02013;22 nm diameter and variable rod length of 30 to 200 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

In the N-PbCS sample, RNPs appeared less rigid than N-only RNPs with length spanning from 30 to 70 nm. Most N-PbCS RNPs were detected in microenvironments where discrete rings were visible next to rod-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Because of the lower expression level of N-PbCS as compared to N, the N-PbCS clarified lysate was submitted to two ultracentrifugation rounds to concentrate N-PbCS structures, while N sample was not. This explains the differences observed in average rod length in both samples, as previously observed for N RNPs in yeast <xref rid="pone.0086658-Slibinskas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, after the first round of ultracentrifugation we selected the fractions containing RNPs of around 333 N molecules, which represented the major population as compared to shorter or longer RNP structures present in the other ultracentrifugation fractions or pellet.

Remarkably, the detection of significant IgG1 and IgG2a/b humoral responses underlines the elicitation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokine environments after vaccination with the whole recombinant N-PbCS yeast in the absence of accessory adjuvants.</p><p>Anti-N IgG antibodies became detectable after the third injection in mice immunized with N or N-PbCS yeasts and reached highest titers at day 42. The anti-N response at day 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) was statistically comparable in both N and N-PbCS immunized groups, excluding immune interference between N and PbCS antigens in anti-N humoral response. The anti-N antibody response was more variable among the animals than the anti-PbCS response, with even three mice from both groups that remained negative. This was not due to administration or vaccine uptake problems, as the two negative mice from the N-PbCS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) had high anti-PbCS responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

From day 3 to 6 after challenge, the parasitemia was comparable in the N, PbCS and WT groups where iRBC reduction was not statistically different from the naive control group, however the N group showed a difference from the naive group at day 5 (p&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, parasitemia was significantly reduced in the N-PbCS group (notably around 4&#x02013;fold at day 5 post-challenge; p&#x0003c;0.005 at days 4 and 5, and p&#x0003c;0.0005 at day 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). The parasitemia reduction observed in animals immunized with N-PbCS as compared to animals immunized with PbCS correlates with the induction of PbCS antibodies and confirms that multimerization of the antigen on RNPs made the difference. We observed that mice dying early (day 7&#x02013;14) presented clinical signs of experimental cerebral malaria, whereas after day 20 mice died as a consequence of hyper-parasitemia (up to 35&#x02013;55% of iRBCs/RBCs at day 20, and 60&#x02013;70% at day 25). The parasitemia at day 5 and the day of death showed a significant inverse correlation (Spearman test; p&#x0003c;0.005): a low parasitemia (0&#x02013;0.2%) preferentially resulted in a late death, while a higher parasitemia (&#x0003e;0.2%) resulted in a more rapid death associated with experimental cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086658-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).

Nevertheless, a similar benefit on survival at later times was also observed in the group of mice immunized with yeasts expressing N only, thus indicating that N may contribute to the survival advantage observed in the N-PbCS group. Notably, in the N-PbCS group, mice with the highest anti-PbCS IgG levels had the most prolonged survival, although antibody titers were not predictive of early or late animal death outcome (Mann-Whitney nonparametric test).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Vaccine manufacturers largely use yeast as bioreactor for producing high amounts of low cost vaccines, the best example being the anti-hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine (ENGERIX-B&#x000ae;).

Injected subcutaneously in the absence of accessory adjuvants and at low antigen dose (130 ng PbCS per injection), the N-PbCS <italic>P. pastoris</italic> induced a significant delay in the emergence of parasitemia as well as prolonged survival of recipient C57Bl/6 mice following a stringent challenge consisting in the intradermal injection of a high number (6,000) of infectious <italic>Pb</italic> sporozoites. Comparing both the induction of specific antibodies to PbCS antigen and the outcome of experimental challenge among N, PbCS and N-PbCS immunization groups indicates that multimerization of PbCS on RNPs was necessary to significantly decrease early parasitemia and to increase mice survival. However, we also observed that measles virus N carrier protein contributes by itself, together with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigen multimerization, to parasitemia delay and to long-term mice survival. This might be due to innate immune responses or to the activation of CD8 or CD4 T-cells, although we could not analyze those responses as no T-cell responses or specific T-epitopes have been described in the C56Bl/6 mouse model of <italic>Pb</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0086658-Hafalla1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Anti-PbCS IgG responses reflected unbiased contribution of Th1 and Th2 immune responses, indicating broad elicitation of the immune system in the absence of accessory adjuvants. Future studies will be dedicated to clarify the specific role in adjuvancy of N-based RNPs and of heat-inactivated whole <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yeast, as well as the possible role of T cell responses.</p><p>Nevertheless, this initial study shows that expression of the CS antigen in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> needs to be improved. It is assumed that the CS proteins from <italic>Pb</italic> (infecting mice) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (infecting humans) share conformational and function properties, although they present around 60% divergent amino acids sequences <xref rid="pone.0086658-Plassmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. To determine whether CS expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> depends on specific protein sequence, we generated MV-N fusion proteins with equivalent CS domains from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain 3D7; PfCS) and from PbCS. Full length N-PfCS (92.73 kDa) was produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> GS115 and KM71 at 97 ng/YU (data not shown), while N-PbCS (91.32 kDa) was not produced in GS115 or KM71 strains, and only at lower yield in SMD1168 strain (12 ng/YU). These data indicate that primary amino acid sequence determines the efficiency of N-CS fusion protein expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. Yeast proteases are major actors in foreign protein degradation. As only general knowledge is available on protease targets essentially from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, further studies are required for improving the yield of production of MV-N based fusion protein in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. Nevertheless, the better production yield observed for PfCS as compared to PbCS in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> is favorable for developing a human vaccine relying on this strategy.</p><p>The administration regimen is an important issue for whole inactivated yeast. In this study, we show that three injections at one-week interval were necessary to elicit detectable anti-CS antibody response in most mice. In preliminary experiments we observed that three injections at two-week interval (d0, d14, d28) did not induce anti-CS antibodies or parasitemia delay (data not shown). Whether this is due to the low expression level of N-PbCS in SMD1168 strain (12 ng/YU) or to the intrinsic feature of whole recombinant <italic>P. pastoris</italic> needs to be addressed. Increasing antigen production yield by further selection of expressing clones is obviously required. However, frequent boosts might be needed to elicit robust long-term immune responses. Multiple doses with whole recombinant yeast were tested as administration protocols for therapeutic vaccination with myostatin <xref rid="pone.0086658-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, K-Ras oncoprotein <xref rid="pone.0086658-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> or HCV NS3 and Core (GI-5005; <xref rid="pone.0086658-Haller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). Notably in this last study, up to 13 weekly doses of whole recombinant yeast showed no yeast neutralization in mouse or toxicity in rabbit, and cellular immune responses increased in parallel with injection frequency <xref rid="pone.0086658-Haller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, for logistic and economic reasons, no more than three vaccine administrations can be scheduled for preventive immunization of infants living in areas of malaria endemicity. Future improvement of whole recombinant yeast such as increasing the antigen expression level, testing alternative administration pathways or yeast formulation, has to be addressed to enhance vaccine efficiency with fewer administrations.</p><p>Many immunogenic antigens from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites were described. Although correlates of protection against malaria in humans are still elusive, the combination of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigens from both the asexual and sexual phases of infection in a single multi-stage formulation might make it possible to induce sterile immunity in humans and prevent parasite transmission. Current vaccine platforms towards malaria provide either monovalent (subunit or DNA/viral vector vaccine candidates), or multivalent formulations (whole organism vaccine candidates: i.e. genetically attenuated parasites, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, and live-parasite immunization under antimalarial therapy) <xref rid="pone.0086658-Salvador1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The monovalent vaccine platforms, even in heterologous immunization protocols, result in poorly diversified antigen combinations and show at best partial protection towards infection. By providing all antigens from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> at specific replication stages, same vaccine protocols from the multivalent vaccine strategies are successful in eliciting sterile immunity. However, whole organism vaccine candidates are still limited by hardly solvable logistic problems for large-scale production, distribution and delivery in developing countries.</p><p>Mixtures of whole recombinant yeast clones, each expressing relevant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigens for the asexual and sexual stages, provide the means to deliver multi-antigen cocktails in a vaccine formulation which can guarantee low costs of production and be independent from cold chain constraints for vaccine delivery in developing countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Recombinant Yeast Production and Characterization</title><p>The N and the PbCS nucleotide sequences were synthesized and optimized for expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (GeneScript), and cloned within <italic>EcoRI</italic> and <italic>NotI</italic> restriction sites into the pPIC3.5K plasmid (Invitrogen) for yeast expression under the control of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter.
