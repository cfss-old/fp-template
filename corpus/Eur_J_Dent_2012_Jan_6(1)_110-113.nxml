Suture progenitor cells with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR2) that have undergone a mutation cannot transduce signals from extracellular fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Therefore, these cells do not receive the signal to produce the necessary fibrous material essential for a normal calvarial suture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dent06_p0110">3</xref></p><p>Apert syndrome was first reported by Wheaton in 1894 and French pediatrician Eugene Apert published a series of nine cases in 1906.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent06_p0110">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dent06_p0110">4</xref> Most cases are sporadic, with an incidence of 1:160 000; however due to high infant mortality, the incidence in the general population is lower. Advanced male parental age has been consistently noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dent06_p0110">5</xref> During the course of the disease, growth and mental retardation can be observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent06_p0110">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dent06_p0110">5</xref></p><p>In Apert cases, the spheno-occipital and spheno-ethmoidal synchondroses and the fronto-ethmoidal suture fuse early, resulting in a severely shortened posterior cranial base and a relatively short anterior cranial base with a resultant hypoplastic midface. Consistent with the observation of midface hypoplasia, the maxilla also exhibits a transverse deficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dent06_p0110">3</xref> The most readily observed malocclusions are a severe maxillary anterior open bite and a severely crowded and retrusive maxillary arch due to the constricted secondary palate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dent06_p0110">3</xref> The maxillary alveolar arch is V-shaped.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dent06_p0110">6</xref> Due to the narrower maxillary arch, bilateral or unilateral posterior crossbite can be observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dent06_p0110">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dent06_p0110">7</xref> Impactions, severe crowding of developing teeth within the alveolus, delayed eruption, thick gingiva, and sometimes supernumerary teeth or congenitally missing teeth are the hall marks of maxillary dental development in Apert patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dent06_p0110">8</xref> The nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal attenuation cause Apert&#x02019;s individuals to become mouth breathers with a resultant anterior open bite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dent06_p0110">3</xref></p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 16-day-old female infant was admitted to the Department of Orthodontics of Selcuk University because of cleft palate. From her parents&#x02019; history, there was no syndromic individual in the family. She was the second child from a normal mother&#x02019;s third pregnancy of a consanguineous marriage between cousins. The mother&#x02019;s first child had died due to respiratory failure. Apert syndrome was diagnosed by DNA analysis and physical examination in the medical faculty.</p><p>During extraoral examination of the infant, whose appearance was noted with defects, it was observed that he displayed a cone-shaped calvarium, midface hypoplasia, hypertelorism, ocular proptosis, shallow orbits, down-slanting lateral canthi and palpebral fissures, a depressed nasal bridge, low-set ears, and syndactyly of the fingers and toes (excluding the thumbs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dent06_p0110">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dent06_p0110">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dent06_p0110">3</xref>). The baby had a dehydrated, weak appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dent06_p0110">Figure 1</xref>). Intraoral clinical examination revealed that upper and lower alveolar bases were normal, and a bifid uvula and secondary cleft palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dent06_p0110">Figures 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dent06_p0110">5</xref>) were presented.</p><p>The maxillary impression was taken by using silicon-based impression material (Zhermack SpA, Badia Polesine, Italy) and an orthodontic plaster model was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dent06_p0110">Figures 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dent06_p0110">5</xref>). After the cleft was covered with the wax, the acrylic appliance was made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dent06_p0110">Figure 6</xref>). Feeding the baby and orientating the growth was the goal of using this appliance for treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dent06_p0110">9</xref></p><p>The appliance was worn on the patient, and the parents were instructed in full-time wear and cleaning procedures of the appliance. The parents was also informed about feeding the baby in a vertical position, using a nipple with a small hole through which milk flow rate was in the form of intermittent drops; therefore, the infants&#x02019;s perioral and buccal muscles would strengthen.</p><p>The baby was checked at intervals of six weeks for a period of six months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dent06_p0110">Figure 5</xref>). If it was necessary, the appliance was renewed during this period. When the baby was eight months, an operation was done to correct anomalies in the skull.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A silicon-based impression material was preferred to make the maxillary impression easier. During the impression, the head of infant is laid on the clinician&#x02019;s left knee. The baby&#x02019;s head is tilted backwards by holding the left knee forward.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dent06_p0110">9</xref></p><p>It is postulated that mutation in the FRFR2 gene has an effect on the mesenchymal development, which has an effect on tooth morphogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dent06_p0110">10</xref> Many oral manifestations can be attributed to the presence of this mutation.</p><p>Failure in the anteroposterior and downward growth of the maxilla causes the maxillary hypoplasia and a resultant contraction of nasopharyngeal airway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dent06_p0110">11</xref> Therefore, one should pay attention to obstructive sleep apne syndrome and premature death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent06_p0110">1</xref></p><p>In patients with Apert syndrome, severe skeletal Class III open bite malocclusion can be observed due to the maxillary deficiency and the inclination of the upper jaw. Therefore, it is usually necessary to add ortognathic surgery to the treatment plan. The infant is likely to suffer from oral hygiene problems during treatment.</p><p>For the patient with Apert syndrome, oral hygiene is as important as it is difficult. Hand deformities make it difficult to brush the teeth. The new generation of electric tooth brushes and fluoride mouth rinses may make the task easier. Professional care -including frequent dental examinations, oral hygiene prophylaxis, fluoride treatments, and dental sealants- are very important.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dent06_p0110">4</xref></p><p>Tosun and Sener&#x02019;s study showed that Apert syndrome was in parallel with G<sub>6</sub>PD deficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dent06_p0110">4</xref> G<sub>6</sub>PD deficiency is an enzymatic hereditary disorder leading to hemolytic anemia as a result of red blood cell destruction. The main problem in G<sub>6</sub>PD deficiency is that hemolysis can be precipitated by a number of factors, such as oxidant drugs, eating fava beans, or intercurrent infection. Drugs that may induce hemolysis include sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, aspirin, acetaminophen, penicillin, and streptomycin. Therefore, the dentist must avoid drugs that may potentially induce hemolysis as result of G<sub>6</sub>PD deficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dent06_p0110">4</xref></p><p>A significant proportion of patients with Apert syndrome has mental retardation. It is reported that 52% of the patients&#x02019; IQ has been lower than 70. In these patients, significant social problems, speech difficulties, and attention deficit are noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent06_p0110">1</xref></p><p>In Apert syndrome, definite diagnosis can be made by DNA analysis. Crouzon syndrome -another craniosynostosis disorder- is the result of the same gene mutation occurring in different locations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent06_p0110">1</xref></p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This case demonstrates the general characteristic of a patient with Apert&#x02019;s syndrome. However, the treatment of these patients requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Orthodontists can achieve an improvement in the patient&#x02019;s appearance and function of dentoskeletal structures by a combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment plan.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-dent06_p0110"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alp</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Alp</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Koc</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ucar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cimen</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Apert syndrome</article-title><source>T&#x000fc;rkiye Klinikleri J Pediatr</source><year>2007</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>264</fpage><lpage>268</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-dent06_p0110"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Canpolat</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buyukayhan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunes</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Akcakus</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ozturk</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurtoglu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Apert syndrome: A case report</article-title><source>Erciyes Medical Journal</source><year>2009</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>53</fpage><lpage>61</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-dent06_p0110"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rynearson</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Case Report: Orthodontic and dentofacial orthopedic considerations in Apert&#x02019;s syndrome</article-title><source>Angle Orthod</source><year>2000</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>252</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10926435</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-dent06_p0110"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tosun</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sener</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Apert syndrome with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: A case report</article-title><source>Int J Paediatr Dent</source><year>2006</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>218</fpage><lpage>221</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16643545</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-dent06_p0110"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Facial dysmorphism and syndrome diagnosis</article-title><source>Pediatric orofacial medicine and pathology</source><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chapman &#x00026;
