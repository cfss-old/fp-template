These patients exhibit striking differences in the rate of HIV-1 disease progression which could provide insights into mechanisms of control. We hypothesized that differences in the pattern of immunodomination including breadth, magnitude and polyfunctionality of HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell response could partially explain differences in progression rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we mapped, quantified, and assessed the functionality of these responses against individual HIV-1 Gag peptides in 58 HIV-1 vertically infected adolescents. Subjects were divided into two groups depending upon the rate of disease progression: adolescents with a sustained CD4&#x00025;&#x02265;25 were categorized as having no immune suppression (NS), and those with CD4&#x00025;&#x02264;15 categorized as having severe immune suppression (SS). We observed differences in the area of HIV-1-Gag to which the two groups made responses. In addition, subjects who expressed the HLA- B&#x0002a;57 or B&#x0002a;42 alleles were highly likely to restrict their immunodominant response through these alleles. There was a significantly higher frequency of na&#x000ef;ve CD8&#x0002b; T cells in the NS subjects (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0066) compared to the SS subjects. In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in any other CD8&#x0002b; T cell subsets. The differentiation profiles and multifunctionality of Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells, regardless of immunodominance, also failed to demonstrate meaningful differences between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Together, these data suggest that, at least in vertically infected adolescents, the region of HIV-1-Gag targeted by CD8&#x0002b; T cells and the magnitude of that response relative to other responses may have more importance on the rate of disease progression than their qualitative effector functions.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host factors have a strong influence on the HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell response and the consequent level of control exerted upon viral replication. Of particular importance are the genes contained within the MHC where diversity of class I driven responses have shown an advantage with regards to disease progression in HIV-1 disease. For example, individuals who are homozygous at any of the three HLA class I loci have a more rapid progression to AIDS, compared to those who are heterozygous at these alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Carrington1">[1]</xref> suggesting an advantage to having a diverse repertoire of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Addo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Addo2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Betts1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Cao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Frahm1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Jin1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>HLA class I further influences immune responses by restricting the CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses against a number of possible epitopes dictated by peptide binding specificities of the HLA allele. The size of each response generated by each epitope gives rise to a hierarchical order of responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Lichterfeld1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Yu1">[9]</xref>. Within the hierarchy, the greatest response is defined as immunodominant, while the weaker responses are considered subdominant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Yewdell1">[10]</xref>. Development of immunodominant responses is dependent on many factors, including the kinetics of viral protein expression, the autologous sequence of the infecting virus in addition to the HLA alleles expressed by the individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Yewdell1">[10]</xref>. The possession of certain immunodominant responses may be an important factor in establishing control over HIV-1 as has been observed in individuals expressing the &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; alleles HLA-B&#x0002a;27 and -B&#x0002a;57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Lichterfeld1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Altfeld1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Altfeld2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Streeck1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Viral control may also be linked to CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses against specific epitopes that afford a greater (or lesser) degree of protection for the host. This concept is strengthened by the consistent association of some HLA Class I alleles with HIV-1 disease progression rates; the association of HLA-B&#x0002a;27 and HLA-B&#x0002a;57 with long-term non-progression and HLA-B&#x0002a;35 with rapid disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Carrington2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Carrington3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-OBrien1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Saah1">[17]</xref>. However, expression of an allele and subsequent response to a protective epitope alone is not alone sufficient to confer a disease progression pattern. In a study comparing the HIV-1-specific immune response between HLA-B&#x0002a;57 long term non-progressors (LTNPs) and HLA-B&#x0002a;57 typical progressors, the LTNPs focused more of their responses to peptides known to be HLA-B&#x0002a;57-restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Migueles1">[18]</xref> suggesting the dominance of the dominance of immune response is also important.</p><p>The targeted viral gene product is an additional variable that may impact disease course. The presence of an HIV-1-Gag-specific response has been shown to be associated with a better clinical outcome. Several studies in chronically infected adult patients have shown that individuals whose immune response is preferentially targeted against Gag progress more slowly and/or have a lower viral load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Addo2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Edwards1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Kiepiela1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Riviere1">[21]</xref>. Studies have shown that individuals who control their virus preferentially target Gag derived epitopes during acute infection, and this is also seen in individuals who express the protective alleles HLA-B&#x0002a;27 or HLA-B&#x0002a;57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Altfeld2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Geldmacher1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Streeck2">[23]</xref>. Importantly, one of the few studies performed in perinatally infected infants showed that children with Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses exhibited significantly lower viral loads than those that did not respond to Gag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Huang1">[24]</xref>. These data strongly suggest that T cell responses directed against the Gag protein are beneficial and may contribute to slower HIV-1 disease progression in both adults and children.</p><p>This study was performed to investigate the importance of immunodominant CD8&#x0002b; responses in the clinical progression of perinatally HIV-1-infected adolescents using responses to HIV-1 Gag to interrogate the key parameters. We hypothesized that differences in the breadth, magnitude, polyfunctionality and immuondomination patterns of the HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell response could explain differences in rate of progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subject Cohort Characteristics</title><p>Peripheral blood samples from 58 children and adolescents with vertically acquired HIV-1 were analyzed.

Biotinylated anti-IFN-&#x003b3; mAb 7-B6-1 (Mabtech) was added at 1 &#x000b5;g/ml, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hr Plates were washed with PBS&#x0002b;0.1&#x00025; Tween 20 and treated with streptavidin-bound alkaline phosphatase. After 1 h incubation, plates were washed with PBS&#x0002b;0.1&#x00025; Tween 20 and developed using Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit III (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). IFN-&#x003b3; spot-forming units (SFUs) were visualized and counted using an AID EliSpot reader (Autoimmun Diagnostika GMBH, Germany). Spots were standardized to SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC. Spots formed in the presence of media alone were considered non-specific background and subtracted from the SFU in stimulated wells. A reading of 30 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs after the subtraction of non-specific background spots was considered positive, as previously defined by pediatric studies, using the same or a similar assay, performed by our lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Sharp1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Sandberg1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Jordan1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021135-Chandwani1">[53]</xref>.

The negative control was media alone and the positive control was staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). A peptide pool consisting of CMV, EBV and Influenza epitopes (CEF) was also used in the assay.</p><p>Briefly, cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and cells were stimulated for one hour with either media alone, antigen, or positive control. The antibody, CD107 a/b-PECy5 was added with stimulation. Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) was then added at a concentration of 5 &#x000b5;g/ml, and cells incubated overnight. The next day, PBMC were washed and stained with antibodies, in different combinations, against CD4-Alexa700, CD8-Pacific Blue, CD45RA-biotin, CCR7-PECy7, CD57-PECy5, CD279(PD-1)-PE, and a live/dead marker emitting in the aqua wavelength, for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were washed twice and stained with the secondary antibody streptavidin-Qdot655 for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were then washed and fixed in 2&#x00025; paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized using FACS Perm solution (BD Biosciences), washed and stained using antibodies, in different combinations, against CD3-ECD, IFN-&#x003b3;-APC, TNF-&#x003b1;-FITC, and MIP-1&#x003b2;-PE for 30 minutes at 25&#x000b0;C. Following staining, the cells were washed, fixed in 1&#x00025; paraformaldehyde, and collected on a BD LSR-II using FACS DIVA software (BD Biosciences). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Gating Strategy</title><p>In all analyses, forward scatter (FSC)-height versus FSC-area plot was used to exclude all cell conjugates. Dead cells were then excluded by only gating on cells negative for the live/dead marker. A FSC-area vs. side scatter (SSC)-area plot was used to define the lymphocyte gate. T cells were selected by gating on CD3&#x0002b; lymphocytes, followed by selection of CD8&#x0002b; cells by gating on CD3&#x0002b;CD8&#x0002b; cells. CD4&#x0002b; cells were defined as CD3&#x0002b;CD8&#x02212; cells. In panels with CD3, CD4, and CD8 antibodies, on average, 93&#x00025; of CD3&#x0002b;CD8&#x02212; cells were CD4&#x0002b;. CD57&#x0002b; cells were defined using a FITC &#x0201c;fluorescence minus one&#x0201d; (FMO) sample. Quadrant gates were set for expression of CCR7 and CD45RA by using a QDot655 FMO and a PECy7 FMO. IFN-&#x003b3;&#x0002b; cells were defined using an APC FMO. IFN-&#x003b3;&#x0002b; cells were further analyzed for expression of T-cell memory markers in a CCR7 versus CD45RA.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>A median (interquartile range) was used as a measure of central tendency for continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney two-tailed t-test was used for all simple comparisons between two groups. The Spearman Rank correlation test and linear regression analyses were used to explore associations between 2 continuous variables. Differences between categorical data were calculated using Fisher's exact test. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 4.03 software package (La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients and their families for participating in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>Funding was provided by a grant from the NIH AI060379.
