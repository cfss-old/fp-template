The study comprised 52 male Wistar rats, divided in 5 groups, during a 20-week protocol: control: vehicle, carcinogen: 0.05% of <italic>N</italic>-butyl-<italic>N</italic>-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN), CEL: 10&#x02009;mg/kg/day of the selective COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, preventive CEL (CEL+BBN-P), and curative CEL (BBN+CEL-C) groups. Although tumor growth was markedly inhibited by the preventive application of CEL, it was even aggravated by the curative treatment. The incidence of gross bladder carcinoma was: control 0/8(0%), BBN 13/20(65%), CEL 0/8(0%), CEL+BBN-P 1/8(12.5%), and BBN+CEL-C 6/8(75%). The number and volume of carcinomas were significantly lower in the CEL+BBN-P versus BBN, accompanied by an ample reduction in hyperplasia, dysplasia, and papillary tumors as well as COX-2 immunostaining. In spite of the reduction of tumor volumes in the curative BBN+CEL-C group, tumor malignancy was augmented. An anti-inflammatory and antioxidant profile was encountered only in the group under preventive treatment. In conclusion, preventive, but not curative, celecoxib treatment promoted a striking inhibitory effect on bladder cancer development, reinforcing the potential role of chemopreventive strategies based on cyclooxygenase 2 inhibition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Bladder cancer is a prevalent tumor, accounting for 5%&#x02013;10% of all malignancies in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has a high recurrence and progression rate and the prognosis, except for superficial forms, is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, it has high mortality rates and socioeconomic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The conventional surgical techniques and therapeutic options might cause discomfort to patients, especially in invasive and aggressive forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the improvement of bladder cancer management and treatment could rely on better preventive strategies. The identification of promising drugs remains dependent on a better elucidation of the molecular/cellular mechanisms underlying cancer appearance and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Apart from the genetic features and markers already characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the cellular and molecular mechanisms for development and/or progression might involve inflammatory, proliferative, and oxidative stress phenomena that should be better elucidated.</p><p>Inflammation through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway has been involved in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While COX-1 is constitutively expressed in a huge range of tissues, playing a role in prostaglandins production and maintenance of homeostasis, COX-2 expression is induced by cytokines and growth/tumor factors, usually as a reaction to an inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have been suggesting a key role of COX-2 in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and its modulation has been associated with reduction of tumor incidence in experimental and clinical studies for distinct types of carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since COX-2 overexpression has been reported in bladder tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], COX-2 inhibitors (Coxibs) might be viewed as promising for chemoprevention of this cancer. </p><p>Bladder cancer, induced in rats with the carcinogen <italic>N</italic>-butyl-<italic>N</italic>-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN), has been used as a model for study pathophysiology and therapeutics of this cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], particularly due to the histological similarities with the human transitional cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated a positive response to some prevention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but the curative efficacy of new and promising pharmacological options, such as the celecoxib, remains to be elucidated. Considering the poor prognosis for a high percentage of the patients diagnosed for bladder cancer, as well as the high recurrence and progression rates, curative strategies might assume a key relevance in the management/treatment of these carcinomas in many patients.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate, using a rat bladder carcinogenesis model, the preventive versus curative efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib (CEL) on bladder cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Treatments were performed according to a two-step protocol: a first period of eight weeks for tumor induction and pharmacological treatment (orange juice, BBN, CEL control, and preventive CEL) and a second one of 12 weeks for cancer expression/prevention. In the curative treatment, rats were first treated with BBN for 8 weeks and, thereafter, with CEL until the week 20. BBN was given in drinking water and orange juice (given to all groups) and CEL (prepared in vehicle) were given by an esophageal cannula. All the animals have completed the 20-week protocol. Body weight and beverage consumption were monitored during the entire experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Sections were deparaffinized and blocked for endogenous peroxidase in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 20 minutes. Antigen enhancement was performed by pretreating with microwave heating in a citrate buffer, pH 6.00 (twice for 5 minutes each at 750&#x02009;W). The slides were washed three times, 2 minutes each, and then incubated with blocking serum for 10 minutes to block the nonspecific binding. The excess of blocking serum was removed, and then the sections were incubated at 4C overnight with primary polyclonal antibody against COX-2 at proper dilution and secondary antibody was then applied (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Reactivity was visualized with an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase system using diaminobenzidine as the chromogen and Mayer's hematoxylin as the counterstain. Sections of normal urothelium were included in all experiments. In addition, many tumor sections contained adjacent normal bladder mucosa, which served as internal controls. Known strong COX-2 staining specimens served as positive controls.

The number of rats with tumor, the number of tumors per rat, and the volume of each tumor were reported in order to further calculate the % of rats with tumor in each group, the number of tumors per rat with tumor, as well as the mean tumor volume per rat and per tumor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>All the bladders from the control animals have revealed a pattern of normality, with absence of any type of malignity. The wall texture, thickness, and vascularization were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Similar profile was found for the CEL group, with limpid, translucent, and tiny bladders, without presence of any abnormal mass or vascularization (data not shown). In the BBN group, however, 65.0% of the rats had bladder tumors, almost all easily seen by macroscopic analysis. The bladder walls were thicker, with new or enlarged small vessels, suggesting neo-angiogenesis, and there was unequivocal formation of tumor. Furthermore, some bladders presented more than one tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In the preventive CEL+BBN-P group, apart from one case, all bladders show a similar pattern to those seen for the control or CEL rats, with macroscopically unrecognized signs of abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), which contrasts with the bladders from the curative BBN+CEL-C group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec3.1.2"><title>3.1.2. Quantitative Evaluation</title><p>In the control group, as expected, no rat developed bladder cancer. The same profile was found for the CEL animals. In the BBN group (<italic>n</italic> = 20 rats), the percentage of rats with bladder cancer was 65.0% (13 in 20), with a mean of 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 tumors per rat with tumor. Furthermore, the mean tumor volume per rat with tumor (in 13 rats) was 138.5 &#x000b1; 7.5&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> and the mean tumor volume per tumor (in 16 tumors) was 112.5 &#x000b1; 6.4&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). In the preventive CEL treatment (CEL+BBN-P group), there was notorious bladder cancer prevention, with a percentage of tumors in the group of 12.5% (1 in 8), which corresponds to only one rat with cancer in the group universe of 8 animals. In agreement, the mean tumor volume per rat with tumor was 21.2 and per tumor (in 4 tumors of only 1 rat) was 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). This pattern contrasts with the ineffective curative CEL treatment (BBN+CEL-C group), which did not show relevant inhibitory effect on tumor growth, demonstrated by the even higher percentage of rats with tumors 75% (6 in 8) and number of tumors per rat with tumour (1.8 &#x000b1; 0.5, representative of 11 tumors in 6 bladder with tumor), versus the BBN group. However, the decreased tumor volume should be reported: the mean tumor volume per rat with tumor (in 6 rats) was 59.8 &#x000b1; 20.8&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> and the mean tumor volume per tumor (in 11 tumors) was 35.9 &#x000b1; 14.8&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec3.1.3"><title>3.1.3.

The bladder from control animals had no signs of preneoplasic lesions (neither hyperplasia nor dysplasia), as well as those from the CEL rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). In the carcinogen (BBN) group, there was evident malignant transformation, including hyperplasia (100%) and dysplasia (100%), present in all the animals, including those without tumor formation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c1)</xref>). Furthermore, there were also malignant lesions, papillary, infiltrative, and CIS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c2)</xref>). The preventive use of CEL (group CEL+BBN-P) has undoubtedly prevented bladder cancer development. Therefore, as above mentioned, only one bladder of the 8 rats from the group has shown cancer development (12.5% of the rats from the group) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Apart from the rat with tumors (all papillary), whose urothelium has demonstrated hyperplasia and dysplasia, without infiltrative or CIS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d1)</xref>), all the other rats have presented a normal urothelium profile (there was only low-grade hyperplasia in two of those 7 animals) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d2)</xref>). On the contrary, the curative CEL treatment (BBN+CEL-C group), despite lower tumor volume (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>), not only did not reverse tumor (75%) and preneoplasic lesions (hyperplasia and metaplasia) development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(e1)</xref>) but also promoted increased malignancy, presenting more aggressive (T1G2) carcinomas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(e2)</xref>). </p><p>The lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys, and intestines were normal on gross inspection and on histological examination for all the groups under study.

As a result, the ratio MDA/TAS was reduced in the CEL group and unchanged in the BBN rats, versus the control significantly diminished in the preventive CEL treatment (CEL+BBN-P group), and notably increased in the curative CEL group (BBN+BBN-C), versus the BBN animals (Figure&#x02009;&#x02009;4(c)). </p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.3"><title>3.3.

In the preventive CEL+BBN-P treatment (d), only one bladder of the 8 rats presented tumor formation, in which COX-2 staining was encountered, but only in the external layer of the papillary tumor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(d1)</xref>), while no significant staining was found in the nontumoral urothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(d2)</xref>). In the curative CEL treatment (BBN+CEL-C group), in which Celecoxib use was performed between the weeks 12 and 20, after which the bladders were collected, the non-neoplasic areas showed a clear inhibition of COX-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(e1)</xref>), which is in agreement with the treatment performed. However, in the tumor lesion, an intense COX-2 immunostaining was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(e2)</xref>), demonstrating a clear overexpression, similar to that encountered in the BBN-treated rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Renal and Liver Data</title><p>In the BBN group, there was a trend to lower values of urea and higher of uric acid, when compared with the control group, without significant changes of serum creatinine content.

Discussion</title><p>The present study is part of an ongoing preclinical research concerning the effects of distinct agents against urinary bladder cancer prevention or reversion. The main purpose was the assessment of whether the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib is effective as preventive or curative therapy for bladder carcinogenesis in an animal model previously described in the literature using 0.05% of BBN as the carcinogen inductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. </p><p>In recent years, there has been a great interest in the question of whether COX-2 inhibitors could prevent/revert carcinogenesis through COX-2 modulation, which seems to play a key role in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since COX-2 downregulation has been positively linked to chemoprevention in other tissues and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], its efficacy deserves further research on the bladder cancer. Considering that, the second step of our work was to evaluate the potential preventive and curative effect of COX-2 inhibition on bladder carcinoma development and progression. The main finding was that tumor growth is undoubtedly inhibited by CEL treatment, with an incidence of only 12.5% (1 in 8 rats), with a reduced mean tumor volume per tumor of 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (in 4 tumors of 1 rat), contrasting with the data from the BBN rats: 65% and 112.5 &#x000b1; 6.4&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (in 16 tumors of 13 rats with tumor), respectively. Furthermore, and even more relevant, apart from the rats with tumors (all papillary), whose urothelium has demonstrated hyperplasia and dysplasia of low-grade, without infiltrative or CIS, all the other rats (7 in 8) have presented a normal urothelium profile (there was only low-grade hyperplasia in two of those 7 animals). These data confirm that this drug is effective not only for chemoprevention of gross tumor appearance and growth but also for prevention of preneoplasic lesions formation. These data were reinforced by the pattern of immunochemistry found for the group, in which staining was encountered only in the external layer of the papillary tumor region, while no significant staining was found in the nontumoral urothelium. </p><p>Our study showed a remarkable chemopreventive efficacy on tumor growth using a lower COX-2 inhibitor dose (10&#x02009;mg/kg) than those tested in other studies (200, 500, and 1250&#x02009;mg/kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and that better reproduce the doses clinically used for anti-inflammatory actions, thus reinforcing the markedly promising results. Moreover, apart from some deterioration of renal markers, which might be due to deregulation of renal prostanoids pathway or due to low water consumption, CEL treatment has prevented BBN-induced liver impairment, suggesting that a low-dose celecoxib is not aggressive concerning the main organ functions. In relation to the nature of urothelium lesion, the hyperplasia and high-grade dysplasia induced by the carcinogen were highly prevented, decreasing from an incidence of 100% to 12.5%, together with a total prevention of papillary tumors and carcinomas. </p><p>Apart from the chemopreventive effect of selective COX-2 inhibition on cancer development, we were interested in assess the putative regressive action of this drug. In clinical practice, if a similar benefit was confirmed, this curative treatment could be useful for situations of bladder cancer irresponsive for surgical and pharmacological treatments, which is a common situation, as demonstrated by the high recurrence and progression rate and the poor prognosis, particularly for initial superficial forms, namely, when lately diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, surprisingly, when used as curative treatment, the selective COX-2 inhibition was not only unable to inhibit tumor growth and development (75% incidence versus 65% in the carcinogen group) but also showed a promotion of tumor malignancy, demonstrated by the presence of more aggressive tumor types (such as the T1G2). Furthermore, this use of Celecoxib was more deleterious to the liver, as shown by the increased serum markers AST and ALT, contrasting with the preventive CEL treatment.</p><p>Human and animal, in vitro and in vivo, studies have proposed distinct cellular/molecular mechanisms to explain the chemopreventive effects of this group of compounds, particularly in prostate cancer, which includes the expected reduction of inflammation as a result of COX-2 inhibition, as well as other dependent or independent pathways, such as apoptosis induction, inhibition of cell growth, angiogenesis suppression, induction of cell cycle arrest, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) expression, or through other components, namely, of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Not excluding other eventually relevant contributions, according to our data preventive Celecoxib use is able to promote cancer chemoprevention by mechanisms related with its expected anti-inflammatory action, but also with antioxidant properties. Therefore, serum CRP levels were highly reduced when compared with the carcinogen (BBN) group, which was accompanied by a more beneficial redox status profile, given by the lower lipid peroxidation, most likely indicative of reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Thus, considering that inflammation and oxidative stress are key fuels for cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the inhibition of those pathways in very early stages of the carcinogenesis process seems to be crucial for the prevention of tumor growth. This idea is reinforced by the results obtained for the curative celecoxib application, which was unable to reverse cancer progression, even demonstrating a malignant induction. The notorious augment of serum IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in the group with higher tumor incidence (curative CEL group) suggests a special role of this cytokine in carcinogenesis and a potential therapeutic target, as was suggested by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This was accompanied by a huge increment in serum IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, demonstrating that further inflammatory pathways are activated when the celecoxib is used after the tumor induction. Moreover, in spite of lipid peroxidation reduction, the late CEL treatment was responsible for an undoubted aggravation of oxidative stress, most certainly involved in tumor progression. Our data are in agreement with the chemopreventive activity of celecoxib against colon carcinogenesis when the COX-2 inhibitor was administered during the initiation stage of carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In our study, the curative CEL (BBN+CEL-C) group, despite a lower COX-2 staining in non-neoplasic areas, which is in agreement with the treatment performed (Celecoxib was given between the end of BBN treatment, week 12, and the final time for bladder collection: week 20), severe COX-2 immunostaining in the tumor lesion was encountered, demonstrating a clear overexpression, similar to that encountered in the BBN-treated rats.</p><p>The multistep nature of cancer development might provide opportunities for intervention with agents targeted at specific mechanisms involved in the initiation, promotion, and progression stages of cancers. Our data reinforce the pivotal role of inflammation in tumor development as well as the relevance of chemopreventive strategies based on earlier COX-2 inhibition, which might be particularly relevant for high-risk individuals as well as for patients treated for a previous episode of bladder cancer and under high possibility of recurrence. However, attention should be taken when using those drugs in patients with sustained bladder cancer, since, according to our data, cancer growth could not be reversed and, even more preoccupant, might be yet aggravated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Inflammation, with COX-2 overexpression and/or hyperactivity, is a major contributor to bladder tumor development/progression. Inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib proved to be a promising pharmacological modulation as chemoprevention of urinary bladder carcinogenesis if used earlier in tumor growth, as preventive, but not if used as a curative or regressive therapy. Our findings might be viewed as an open promising opportunity for improvement of pharmacological bladder cancer management based on preventive strategies of COX-2 inhibition but should also be viewed as an alert concerning its potential deleterious application in patients with consistent bladder cancer stages. </p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title> Declaration of
