GC-induced apoptosis involves an intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway. BIM (BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a BCL-2 homology 3-only pro-apoptotic protein, is upregulated by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and has an essential role in Dex-induced apoptosis. It has been indicated that Dex-induced BIM is regulated mainly by transcription, however, the molecular mechanisms including responsible transcription factors are unclear. In this study, we found that Dex treatment induced transcription factor Runx2 and c-Jun in parallel with BIM induction. Dex-induced BIM and apoptosis were decreased in cells harboring dominant-negative c-Jun and were increased in cells with c-Jun overexpression. Cells harboring short hairpin RNA for Runx2 also decreased BIM induction and apoptosis. On the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter, c-Jun bound to and activated the AP-1-binding site at about &#x02212;2.7&#x02009;kb from the transcription start site. Treatment with RU486, a GC receptor antagonist, blocked Dex-induced Runx2, c-Jun and BIM induction, as well as apoptosis. Furthermore, pretreatment with SB203580, a p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, decreased Dex-induced Runx2, c-Jun and BIM, suggesting that p38-MAPK activation is upstream of the induction of these molecules. In conclusion, we identified the critical signaling pathway for GC-induced apoptosis, and targeting these molecules may be an alternative approach to overcome GC-resistance in leukemia treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>BIM</kwd><kwd>c-Jun</kwd><kwd>Runx2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are common components in chemotherapeutic regimens for lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> GCs induce apoptosis regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins at the mitochondrial level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The BCL-2 family is subdivided into three main groups based on regions of BCL-2 homology (BH) and function: multi-domain anti-apoptotic (e.g., BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-X<sub>L</sub>), multi-domain pro-apoptotic (e.g., BAX and BAK), and BH3-only pro-apoptotic (e.g. BAD, BID, BIM (BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death), and PUMA).

Accumulating evidence indicates that various external stimuli regulate BIM at several different levels: mRNA transcription, mRNA stability, and posttranslation, for example, phosphorylation. In the context of transcriptional regulation, transcription factors, such as FOXO3a, c-Jun, E2F1, and RUNX1/3, have been reported to regulate <italic>Bim</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that the status of histone acetylation at the <italic>Bim</italic> locus regulates <italic>Bim</italic> expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup>
<italic>Bim</italic> mRNA stability is controlled by cytokine-regulated Hsc70, which binds to AU-rich elements in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> At posttranslational regulation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination of BIM can regulate its protein level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Inhibition of phosphorylation by MEK/ERK inhibitors enhances pro-apoptotic activity of BIM by blocking proteasome-dependent degradation.

It is well known that only a few minutes are required for activated GR to bind to a simple promoter regulating gene expression. (2) The putative human <italic>Bim</italic> promoter does not contain any GR response elements.

The half-life of <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA was identical in control and Dex-treated cells (both for &#x0223c;1.5&#x02009;h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although the absolute level of <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA was &#x0223c;4&#x02013;5 folds higher in Dex-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These data suggest that Dex does not affect the stability of <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA.</p><p>We then performed CEM cells-derived microarray analysis to find the transcription factors in which the expression was significantly changed with Dex treatment. Among several transcription factors in which the expression was up- or downregulated by Dex (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we focused on c-Jun and Runx2 and validated their regulatory roles on <italic>Bim</italic> transcription. Of note, the expression of Runx1 and Runx3 was not altered by Dex treatment (data not shown). We first examined the expression of c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM in CEM cells before the onset of apoptosis, which begins at 24&#x02009;h after Dex treatment in this cell line. The levels of <italic>c-Jun</italic> (1.73&#x000b1;0.04 fold) and <italic>Runx2</italic> (1.46&#x000b1;0.22 fold) mRNA started to increase at 30&#x02009;min after the treatment when <italic>Bim</italic> (1.0&#x000b1;0.08 fold) mRNA expression was still unchanged. <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA started to increase 2&#x02009;h after the treatment and all three mRNAs continued to increase up to 16&#x02013;24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At 24&#x02009;h after Dex treatment, c-Jun, Runx2 and BIM proteins were also accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We examined another Dex-sensitive ALL cell line RS4;11 and found that the mRNAs and proteins of c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM were induced with Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>).

Both Dex-induced BIM expression and cell death were increased proportionally to the levels of exogenous c-Jun expression; highest in CEM/Jun12 and lowest in CEM/Jun 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>). We confirmed that the amount of Dex-induced <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA was significantly less in the cells harboring dominant-negative c-Jun protein and more in the cells with c-Jun overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Downregulation of Runx2 significantly reduced the mRNA and protein induction of not only BIM but also c-Jun with Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>). As a consequence, Dex-induced cell death was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The effect of Runx2 shRNA on Dex-induced BIM expression and apoptosis was reversed when c-Jun was overexpressed in CEM/shRunx2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d&#x02013;f</xref>). These results strongly suggest that Runx2 is a regulator of Dex-mediated BIM as well as c-Jun induction.</p></sec><sec><title>c-Jun but not Runx2 has a direct transcriptional function on the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter</title><p>It has been demonstrated that Runx3 is responsible for transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Bim</italic> in TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In hepatocyte cells, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> also stimulates <italic>Bim</italic> transcription by upregulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3a, and the two factors cooperate in the transcriptional induction of <italic>Bim</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> We searched the c-Jun-binding sites in the human <italic>Bim</italic> promoter and found only one potential AP-1-binding site at about &#x02212;2.7&#x02009;kb from the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, this binding site is located only &#x0223c;20 bases apart from the reported Runx-binding site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> These binding sites are also found within the conserved region of the mouse <italic>Bim</italic> promoter at about &#x02212;2.5&#x02009;kb (data not shown). To examine the function of the putative AP-1- and Runx2-binding sites in the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter in the context of c-Jun and/or Runx 2 expression, a plasmid containing the putative <italic>Bim</italic> AP-1 site upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (<italic>Bim</italic>-luc) was cotransfected with c-Jun and/or Runx2 in 293T cells. Cotransfection with c-Jun activated the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter, but this activation was not augmented by cotransfection with Runx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). c-Jun-mediated activation was not observed when the binding sites were deleted in the <italic>Bim</italic>-luc reporter (&#x02212;1.2&#x02009;kb). We next generated heterologous <italic>Bim</italic> promoter-luciferase reporter constructs containing intact AP-1- and Runx-binding sites, as well as a mutated AP-1- or Runx-binding site. These reporter constructs were cotransfected with the c-Jun or Runx2 expression vector in 293T cells to examine the function of each binding site on the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The construct containing the intact AP-1- and Runx-binding sites was activated with c-Jun but not Runx2 expression. The AP-1 mutant lost not only the basal level but also c-Jun-mediated activation of the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter. In contrast, the reporter gene harboring a Runx mutation behaved similarly to that harboring the intact sequence. To validate the importance of the AP-1-binding site in the context of Dex treatment, the <italic>Bim</italic> reporter constructs were cotransfected with c-Jun in CEM cells. The activity of the <italic>Bim</italic> reporter was increased after Dex treatment and it was further enhanced by c-Jun cotransfection. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, left). The AP-1 mutant activity was decreased not only at the basal level but also with Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, right). These results suggest that c-Jun directly binds and activates the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter, but Runx2 induction by Dex treatment indirectly affects <italic>Bim</italic> promoter activity.</p><p>We confirmed the binding of c-Jun to the putative AP-1 site by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). A DNA&#x02013;protein complex was detected with a probe containing the intact <italic>Bim</italic> AP-1 site, but not with a mutated AP-1 site probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, left). The amount of this complex was increased with Dex-treated nuclear extract when total c-Jun expression was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The decrease of the DNA&#x02013;protein complex by the addition of c-Jun-specific antibody to the reaction mixture confirmed that c-Jun was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, right).

We treated CEM cells with RU486, a GR antagonist, to examine whether RU486 could block c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM induction, as well as apoptosis induced by Dex. Co-treatment with Dex (0.3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) and an excess of RU486 (1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) inhibited c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM induction, as well as apoptosis to the basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a&#x02013;c</xref>), suggesting that all the Dex-mediated induction initiates through GR.</p><p>We have previously shown that p38-MAPK activation followed by BIM induction is critical for Dex-induced apoptosis in CEM cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Treatment with RU486 also inhibited p38-MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We thus examined whether c-Jun and Runx2 induction was also regulated by p38-MAPK activity. CEM cells were treated with SB203580, a p38-MAPK inhibitor, and the levels of c-Jun and BIM with Dex treatment were determined. As a control, SB203580 inhibited Dex-induced phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2, a direct substrate of p38-MAPK (data not shown).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Pretreatment of CEM cells with SB203580 decreased the amount of Dex-induced c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM compared with those in Dex treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6d and e</xref>), suggesting that p38-MAPK activation contributes to c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM induction. As a consequence, Dex-induced apoptosis was also inhibited by SB203580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). In order to clarify whether Dex-induced c-Jun activation is p38-MAPK-dependent, an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct was transfected into CEM cells followed by Dex&#x000b1;SB203580 treatment. The AP-1 luciferase activity was strongly induced by Dex treatment and the induction was abrogated by p38-MAPK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). This result suggests that c-Jun induction and activation by Dex is p38-MAPK-dependent. Taken together, the data suggest that p38-MAPK contributes to Dex-induced apoptosis through c-Jun, Runx2, and BIM induction.</p><p>The FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors, consisting of FOXO3a, FOXO1, and FOXO4, has been shown to function as tumor suppressors and promote their growth-suppressive effects by upregulating the expression of cell-cycle inhibitory genes and pro-apoptotic genes, such as <italic>Bim</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> It has also been shown that FOXO3a activation through the p38-MAPK pathway is involved in arsenite-induced <italic>Bim</italic> transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> We have demonstrated the involvement of the p38-MAPK pathway in Dex-induced BIM induction and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Based on these observations, we examined whether the FOXO proteins were also involved in Dex-induced BIM induction. In CEM cells, the expression of FOXO1 was below detectable by western blot analysis. FOXO3a did not show any significant difference in phosphorylation status and in the amount in the nucleus. In contrast, FOXO4 was dephosphorylated and the amount of FOXO4 in the nucleus was increased after Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2a and b</xref>), indicating FOXO4 translocation and activation. Furthermore, the translocation of FOXO4 into the nucleus was partially inhibited by a p38-MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref>). These observations further prompted us to clarify the role of FOXO4 in Dex-induced BIM expression. We generated CEM cells in which FOXO4 was downregulated by shRNA, however, we did not observe any difference in BIM induction by Dex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2c</xref>). The results suggest that although FOXO4 is translocated into the nucleus by Dex induction with a p38-MAPK activation-dependent manner, it may not regulate Dex-induced BIM expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>GCs are integral components in the treatment protocols of ALL, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma owing to their ability to induce apoptosis in these malignant cells.

Our microarray analysis showed that several transcription factors are up- or downregulated by Dex treatment in CEM cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among them, we focused on c-Jun and Runx2, because (1) it has been shown the involvement of c-Jun in cell death induced by GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and (2) Runx1 and Runx3 have been shown to regulate <italic>Bim</italic> transcription induced by TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in hepatocytes and gastric cancer cells, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Here, we clearly demonstrate that c-Jun and Runx2 are the regulators of <italic>Bim</italic> transcription induced by Dex in ALL cells. The induction of c-Jun and Runx2 by Dex treatment was detected in not only T-ALL CEM cells but also B-ALL RS4;11 cells, indicating that the regulatory mechanism is common. Expression of dominant-negative c-Jun blocked Dex-induced mRNA and protein expression of BIM as well as apoptosis. Reciprocally, overexpression of c-Jun increased Dex-induced mRNA and protein of BIM and apoptosis. Of note, c-Jun overexpression alone slightly induced BIM mRNA and protein (CEM/Jun12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and e</xref>), and BIM expression and apoptosis were further augmented by Dex treatment, suggesting that c-Jun is required for overall BIM expression. Downregulation of Runx2 also reduced Dex-induced BIM and apoptosis. The AP-1- and Runx-binding sites that are potentially bound by c-Jun and Runx2, respectively, are located at &#x0223c;&#x02212;2.7&#x02009;kb of the promoter with &#x0223c;20-bp distance. Interestingly, these potential sites are conserved between human and mouse <italic>Bim</italic> promoters that contain approximately 60&#x00025; homology up to &#x02212;3&#x02009;kb. We demonstrated that the AP-1-binding site could be bound by c-Jun and activated by Dex treatment. In contrast, the Runx-binding site was not activated by overexpression of Runx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, downregulation of Runx2 strongly reduced Dex-induced c-Jun expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that Runx2 is an upstream regulator of c-Jun. AP-1 is known to be a dimeric complex formed by the Jun and Fos family of proteins. However, we could not observe the induction of other Jun and Fos family proteins except c-Jun in our microarray data and western blot analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the protein binding to the <italic>Bim</italic> AP-1 site is a c-Jun homodimer.</p><p>Runx2 belongs to the family of Runt-domain transcription factors, which bind to a common partner, CBF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, to form a core binding factor (CBF) complex and can activate or repress gene transcription. Among the family, Runx2 is well known for its role as a master regulator of bone development. In the context of tumor development, Runx2 functions as pro-oncogenic in leukemia/lymphoma and advanced mammary and prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In contrast, it has been demonstrated that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-induced apoptosis is regulated by Runx1 or Runx3. Recently studies have shown that Runx2 binds to the promoter of BAX and induces BAX expression and apoptosis in response to etoposide or cisplatin treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In our study, Runx2 is involved in Dex-induced <italic>Bim</italic> expression and apoptosis in ALL cells, probably through c-Jun. Of note, the expression of BAX, BAK, BCL-2, BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, and MCL-1 is not altered by Dex treatment in CEM cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> thus BIM is the most important factor in this context.</p><p>The family of FOXO transcription factors is known to regulate <italic>Bim</italic> transcription in a variety of stimuli. We found that FOXO4 was translocated and activated by Dex treatment in CEM cells. However, our <italic>FOXO4</italic> gene-knockdown experiment suggests that it does not have a role in <italic>Bim</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Because Dex treatment makes CEM cells in the G1-phase cell-cycle arrest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> activation of FOXO4 may contribute to the induction of cell-cycle inhibitory genes.</p><p>We explored the connection between Runx2/c-Jun induction and the upstream signaling pathways. GC-induced apoptosis is essentially divided into three stages: (1) an initiation stage, which involves GR activation and GR-mediated gene regulation; (2) a decision stage, which engages pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins at the mitochondrial level; and (3) an execution stage, which involves caspase and endonuclease activation. Ample evidence indicates that the transcriptional activation and repression activity of the GR is required for GC-induced apoptosis. It has been shown that <italic>c-Jun</italic> induction by Dex is primarily a transcriptional phenomenon in CEM cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> In our study, treatment with RU486, a GR antagonist, prevented all downstream events; that is, Dex-induced p38-MAPK activation, Runx2, c-Jun and BIM induction, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a&#x02013;c</xref>). The results indicate that GC binding to GR is essential to GC-mediated induction of downstream molecules. Furthermore, mRNA and protein induction of Runx2, c-Jun, and BIM were also inhibited by the addition of a p38-MAPK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6d and e</xref>). However, this inhibitory effect is significantly imposed on BIM expression and marginally on Runx2 and c-Jun expression. In terms of c-Jun induction, (1) JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) was not activated by Dex treatment, (2) treatment with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, increased, but did not decrease, Dex-induced apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and (3) c-Jun phosphorylation status was not changed by Dex treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the JNK pathway does not contribute to Dex-induced c-Jun induction and apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest the following pathways for BIM induction: (1) dependent on p38-MAPK and Runx2/c-Jun, (2) independent of p38-MAPK but dependent on Runx2/c-Jun, and (3) dependent on p38-MAPK but independent of Runx2/c-Jun. GR-activated and p38-MAPK-activated transcription factors could coordinately regulate Dex-induced BIM expression.</p><p>In conclusion, we found a critical signaling pathway for GC-induced apoptosis. Resistance to GC in ALL is often associated with defects in apoptosis machinery, not in GR. Therefore, further understanding of the precise signaling pathways and molecules in between the activation of GR and BIM induction could help to develop new therapeutic strategies to combat GC-resistant leukemia and possibly other hematological malignancies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>CCRF-CEM, RS4;11, Jurkat, and 293T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
